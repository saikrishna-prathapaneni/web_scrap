Stranded Solutions,"Stranded Solutions is commercializing a patented chemical process that is an industry first combining two well-known technologies to combat GHG emissions and increase oil and natural gas producers’ profits. One technology is the process of direct partial oxidation which combines natural gas with oxygen at elevated temperature and pressure to produce methanol. The other technology is a fluidized bed reactor which is a chamber in which the reaction occurs and that manages temperature and pressure to increase efficiency.  Methanol is a $42+ billion market expected to increase 5-fold by 2050. 
Stranded Solutions’ patented methane-to-methanol conversion technology can be scaled down to 1/100th the size of typical methanol plants, a solution that accommodates diverse types of smaller and non-traditional gas resources such as associated gas flared from oil wells.
Comments from a natural gas producer’s CEO and prospective customer: 
“Stranded Solutions uses the earlier simpler direct reaction process of “partial oxidization” (burning). This is less efficient but less capital intensive.  The potential low capital cost of Stranded Solutions’ process may become a “game changer” in upgrading natural gas in-field to higher value products.”",https://stranded-gas.com

Reco provides this business context.

Reco builds tools to secure sensitive assets for organizations by mapping and monitoring contextual metadata. Using applied machine learning, Reco creates a model of the relationships among an organization’s employees, teams, and third parties as they interact and collaborate, helping security teams understand and visualize threats from collaboration and sharing. In addition, Reco quickly plugs into tools like Slack, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Jira and more to create a contextualized knowledge graph through which security teams can detect and respond to unauthorized or anomalous activity instantly.",https://reco.ai

Paccurate,"Paccurate reduces shipping costs and wasted material by finding the optimal way to pack every shipment. It is crafted with real-world fulfillment concerns in mind, but they make a special effort not to be rigid. 

Cartonization refers to a step somewhere in an order lifecycle where the correct box configuration is determined for optimal shipping. It's a piece of the supply chain puzzle that's becoming more and more critical as ecommerce explodes and parcel carriers struggle with capacity. Typically three things are required to implement cartonization:
- Item Dimensions
- Box Dimensions
- Item/Business Rules & Constraints
Adding any kind of automated cartonization to your fulfillment process can have dramatic effects on your bottom line, but you may find that not all solutions are created equal.

As a rule of thumb, Paccurate more than pays for itself with saved corrugated, averaging a reduction of one square foot per carton in most cases. Reduce filler material by an average 20%. In addition, your negotiated rate tables have incentives built in to pack a certain way, depending on the dim weight and zone - Paccurate is the only cartonization solution that optimizes for these costs directly.",http://paccurate.io

In the last 35 years, noone has marketed a broad spectrum herbicide with a new mechanism - so weeds have evolved to resist one herbicide after the other. Farmers need help. Our lab and greenhouse testing show good activity on broadleaf weeds and against RoundUp resistant weeds.  After more testing,we will enter early development with the right licensee.  This $34B global herbicide mkt needs a product to defeat herbicide resistance.  Our  licensing plan is to receive an upfront payment of $30M, milestone payments over 6 years totaling $150M, and royalties of 5%-10%.

Provallo,"In early 2021, Moshe and Yaniv, who have been friends and colleagues for over a decade, identified a number of long-standing issues and opportunities that had gone unaddressed. Among these were time-critical and real-time protocols that continue to pose challenges.

To address these problems, the duo founded Provallo Inc. The company aims to assist corporations in protecting their assets, boosting productivity and connectivity, and enhancing the performance of time-critical and real-time services.

To achieve this, they developed an innovative engine that employs a unique generative model architecture to automatically create, preprocess, train, and evaluate datasets using various machine learning pipelines. To test the engine's effectiveness, they deployed various service stacks on cloud and hosted environments, closely monitoring performance and security.

Through these efforts, they uncovered a wide range of abusive behavior stemming from public exposure that poses a significant risk to the stability, performance, and security of services, hosts, and environments.

AOE - Accumulated Ocean Energy,"The AOE / OBAS:

AOE was established to implement the patented Wave Energy Conversion technology called the OBAS. This initial technology has led to a total of six patents for associated technologies. These associated technologies can be viewed as accessories that use the compressed air that the OBAS will generate.   

The OBAS is a point-absorber style of wave energy conversion device. It is anchored to the ocean floor using tethers and the motion of ocean waves moves the buoy up to compress air in a specially designed cylinder. One of the key characteristics of the OBAS is that it uses compressed air as the energy storage medium and does not generate electricity in the water, which has been found to be a severe limitation to other wave energy devices due to electrolysis.

Compressed Air Uses:

Aquaculture - Closed Containment Fish Pen Oxygenation

Water Desalination - Pneumatic Reverse Osmosis

Beamy,"Beamy is a SaaS platform enabling the largest enterprises (such as BNP Paribas, Macif or Matmut) to create one single repository of their SaaS applications through our discovery technology, and helping them to better govern the SaaS explosion.

Why Beamy? Because SaaS explosion is ineluctable (KPMG forecasts that the number of SaaS apps in large entreprises will be multiplied by 5 within 10 years and the SaaS Budget by 9. ) The IT department can't handle all the new SaaS requests and the business is implementing new solutions on its own, most of the time without following a proper governance flow. This creates Shadow IT and represents a blind spot for the IT department.
Beamy helps to give visibility over the SaaS ecosystem in order to mitigate the risks related to this Shadow SaaS: Business-IT frictions, Compliance, and Budget (overlaps, redundancy...)

Our clients are the largest entreprises among 3 verticals:
Bank & Insurance (BNPP, Banque Postale, Macif, Matmut...)

Automation Hero,"Automation Hero’s Hero Platform_ is the only completely end-to-end intelligent automation platform on the market that brings humans, AI, OCR, workflows, connectivity and insights together in one platform.
We believe that in order to automate a business process completely, the solution must support all elements: it must keep humans in the loop, be able to process documents, run workflows, integrate IT systems or processes, and provide the appropriate insights. An end-to-end solution is not only more efficient at all of this but it also — most importantly — allows for significantly faster results and therefore democratizes automation in larger and smaller organizations.

A common misconception is that individual tech tools provide better results. Best-in-class software for handwriting translation must be better than software that combines translation with other functions. Right? But in a time where AI capabilities double every 3.5 months, legacy tools are showing their age even faster, and the distance between companies built on modern platforms vs. those with duct-taped legacy tools quickly increases.

GearDraft is based on an algorithm that automatically generates a whole mechanical transmission by inserting a few input data in a short time. The algorithm chooses the components (bearings, shafts, synchronizers, gears), their dimensions and their positions to satisfy the user initial requirements. GearDraft is useful during the blank-sheet pre-design phase, when a new transmission has to be thought from the beginning, or even when a different layout of the components is needed.

The power of the tool is to leave to the user complete freedom on the choice of the algorithm constraints, for instance the overall dimensions of the gearbox and the transmission ratio. Afterwards, the output can be converted into a CAD/FEM interfaceable with other commercial softwares. GearDraft’s aim is to make the user save time, cutting down the preliminary design operations often made “by hand”, and reinvest it for further detailed analyses.",http://gedytrass.com

Vortis Carbon Co.,"Vortis is a carbon management company based in Calgary, AB focused on developing simple and affordable ways to capture, convert, and market Co2 emissions. Over the past three years, in partnership with the University of British Columbia's Clean Energy Research Centre, we have developed a novel approach to carbon capture that uses motion and vortex separation to separate CO2 based on its molecular weight. 

While molecular separation has commercially been proven in applications such as uranium enrichment, it has been overlooked for gas separation and carbon capture due to the need for high rpm's, energy, and costs required to create the high g-forces necessary for separation. Vortis has developed a novel way to overcome these hurdles by creating high g-forces at extremely low RPMs and energy. This approach is a new technology pathway for carbon capture.

intramotev Autonomous Rail,"They are developing a self-driving rail vehicle that enables a point-to-point freight transit model, eliminating the time and costs required to gather and pull static railcars with a locomotive. By putting the motive power in the railcar itself, they can reduce the shipment size and route distance typically required for railroad profitability and enable better competitiveness with trucking .Each year in the US alone, goods worth over $690bn are moved by a fleet of 1.6 million railcars. On any given day, 900,000 of these railcars don't move at all. And on every single leg of its journey, a loaded railcar will sit idle for an average of 24.6 hours - just waiting for a locomotive. Rail’s inefficiencies push many shipments to trucking, which is bad for society. Trucks emit 9x more GHGs per ton-mile than rail, add congestion to roads, and contribute to deadly accidents.

Qualle,"Qualle was established in late 2019 and just launched their soft beta in 2021 with Maersk. Qualle is building out a street turn automation tool, targeted at truckers to request the reuse of containers with shipping lines. A street turn is when a carrier uses a container from one trip, and instead of bringing the empty container back to the rail, they use it for a pickup. The carrier makes money from both loads while running less miles. 

Qualle takes an outdated process of communicating with the Steamship Lines to effectively facilitate Street Turn requests, while empowering truckers to do more by connecting fragmented dots between all stakeholders within the ecosystem. Their software helps with container triangulation to match import containers with exporters demand. Right now navigating and booking street turns is a very manual process and can take hours finding, uploading and negotiating prices through email. With Qualle’s first product “V1” you can do it all on one dashboard within minutes.

With Diesta the insurance premium flows through smart accounts where we automatically reconcile and distribute the payments to each entity.

There are 10’s of thousands of daily requests from early-stage businesses for financial support, POC’s with corporations, and to secure other critical resources. The evaluation, engagement, and decision-making process is manual, costly, and highly inefficient which has forced the industry to take a reactive approach. 

Typically the lifecycle of an early-stage business is 5 years. Within this window a group of them will be out of business, rest will transform into SMB’s, independent corporations, or hyper-growth startups. The majority of the industry waits up to 5 years in order to have enough quantitive results on these companies to make a confident decision on how to engage with them, which is too late.

It is not an imaging radar, but along with cameras covers almost any scenario. We also think of open radar processing libraries and datasets later on.

Problem solved: 
Automotive radars are black boxes developed by a limited amount of suppliers. It happens because, unlike cameras, radars implement either complex high- and low-level processing on the unit due to legacy constraints. Dependency on the limited amount of radar suppliers also disadvantages those who develop sensor fusion systems.

Solution: 
Eliminate bottlenecks in the radar architecture caused by conventional high-level processing. It is now split between a sensor fusion system a new low-level engine on the radar. It has consistent data processing rules that fit a sensor fusion system. The approach shows its best on custom radars but works for radar-on-chip as well.

Recycle Up! Ghana,"In 2014, a group of young Ghanaian and German started an initiative called Recycle Up! Ghana to tackle the tremendous waste challenges in Ghana and the world through education and empowerment of the youth. The approach is based on a core set of beliefs that young people are the change-makers of the future and that local problems need to be solved by local residents. The goal of Recycle Up! Ghana is to train the youth to be able to identify societal challenges such as plastic waste pollution and to develop local sustainable solutions that contribute to alleviating this problem.

Recycle Up! Ghana believes that these plastic waste can be recycled into useful products in an exchange to save the environment from pollution. With this belief we started the Community waste recycling project which  seeks to educate, segregate, collect and recycle post-consumer plastic waste from the community level into useful products like school bags, phone cases, carabiners, furniture, building materials(bricks) etc.

It is through these informal workers, that rePATRN is looking to procure 900 tonnes of PET a month to feed West Africas first food grade PET recycling plant. 
The journey to the recycling plant is divided into three phases. 
In phase 1, the current phase, we are rebuilding our supply network after it collapsed post-COVID. In this phase the entire volume that is procured is sorted by color, separated from contaminants, baled and exported to Europe for recycling. There the material is used for food grade applications, textiles and packaging straps. Once we get back above the levels of September 2019 (857 tonnes), phase 2 will be initiated.

Intermix Performance Materials,"Our polymer additive enables the valorization of mixed plastics at low cost producing a high quality alloy.
 
Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) account for about 2/3 of all plastics in post-consumer waste. Due to their different structures, they are not miscible, resulting in plastic mixtures with unacceptably poor strength. One way to create higher quality recycled materials is to perform careful manual separation, but this is expensive and the separated materials still exhibit performance that is inferior to pure PP and PE unless separation is near perfect.
 
Intermix has developed a polymer additive that when added to a stream of mixed PP and PE enables these two polymers to be combined, yielding a polymer alloy that is mechanically comparable to pure PE and PP samples. This obviates laborious and expensive sorting. The polymer additive is particularly potent - as little as 0.5 wt% effectively compatibilizes mixtures with as much as 30% PP contamination.",https://www.intermixperformancematerials.com

RAPIDFORT,"RapidFort is the first Software Attack Surface Optimization Platform.

Modern cloud workloads include a large number of unused or seldom used components. These components are present either because they might be needed in an emergency or because engineers aren’t sure if they are needed or not. Attackers frequently use these same components to help them “live off the land” and avoid detection once they have compromised a system or, in some cases, facilitate an initial compromise.

Software attack surface is the sum of all software opportunities that unauthorized parties can exploit to access a system. Reducing your software attack surface is an essential security measure.

RapidFort solves this problem by providing organizations with a platform to continuously monitor and minimize their software attack surface. An immediate benefit of RapidFort's solution is that, even before the workload arrives for production deployment, there is a clear understanding of which packages and vulnerabilities are in use by the workload, reducing vulnerability remediation and patch management backlog by 80% on average.

CipherMode Labs,"CipherMode provides a cryptographic software-only solution that protects data during computation. Enterprises will be able to utilize their data while keeping it fully confidential with provable security guarantees. 

The CipherMode platform removes several obstacles in extracting the maximum value from enterprise data: Currently, enterprise data is fragmented, stored in different locations, and managed by isolated teams. Moreover, when information is distributed across different jurisdictions, it is governed by local regulations, which often conflict. Ad-hoc access-control policies for one-off use cases additionally hinder progress and innovation within organizations. The above obstacles lead to data underutilization. 

The CipherMode platform simplifies data workflow and increases efficiency as data can be stored and used securely without business risks. For instance, an enterprise can gather insights and perform data analytics on data stored in different jurisdictions without transferring unencrypted data to a central location. In addition to internal applications, CipherMode software allows collaboration with external entities without disclosing the data, e.g., multiple companies can collaborate and jointly train a better AI model without sharing their private data.",http://ciphermode.tech

ShareSmart,"ShareSmart is transforming the way healthcare professionals deliver care to patients via secure video and messaging.

The use of non-secure smartphone apps and video tech unsuitable for clinical collaboration and virtual health is a significant modern healthcare problem. The incidences of patient data breaches are increasing and are often due to a clinician’s smartphone or software being inadequately secured. 

Many clinicians began offering virtual health consultations during the pandemic and  are now suffering from COVID burnout. Legacy approaches to clinical photography, including bulky digital cameras, out-of-date fax machines, and difficult-to-access electronic medical record systems still forced many to go into the hospital when they didn't need to. The video technology they chose to implement resulted in an increase in patient no shows, overhead and inefficiency. Worse yet, these technologies paired with a reduction in in-person capacity during the pandemic introduced accessibility issues for the most vulnerable populations.

ShareSmart is where high tech begets a high touch approach, driving down the cost of care, improving patient outcomes, and enabling patients to become agents of their own health destiny.",http://sharesmart.ca

In most situations, net-metering is not beneficial, and in these situations, a PowerBloc installation requires no utility approval. By design, PowerBloc is also an off-grid system. PowerBloc uses YouSolar’s compact, lightweight, and highly efficient power electronics in a modular architecture. PowerBloc is very easy to install and fully automated.
