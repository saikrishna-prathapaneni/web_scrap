RAPIDFORT,"RapidFort is the first Software Attack Surface Optimization Platform.

Modern cloud workloads include a large number of unused or seldom used components. These components are present either because they might be needed in an emergency or because engineers aren’t sure if they are needed or not. Attackers frequently use these same components to help them “live off the land” and avoid detection once they have compromised a system or, in some cases, facilitate an initial compromise.

Software attack surface is the sum of all software opportunities that unauthorized parties can exploit to access a system. Reducing your software attack surface is an essential security measure.

RapidFort solves this problem by providing organizations with a platform to continuously monitor and minimize their software attack surface. An immediate benefit of RapidFort's solution is that, even before the workload arrives for production deployment, there is a clear understanding of which packages and vulnerabilities are in use by the workload, reducing vulnerability remediation and patch management backlog by 80% on average.

It’s simple to start with RapidFort and see for yourself. It’s easy; it’s magical! Visit us at www.rapidfort.com, and let us help you run free and stay secure.",http://rapidfort.com

Oncoustics,"Oncoustics is creating and deploying advanced AI solutions for low cost, non-invasive surveillance, diagnostics, and treatment monitoring of diseases with high unmet clinical need.  Unlike other players in the space, we are not doing image recognition.  Instead, we apply AI to raw ultrasound signals from readily available handheld ultrasound devices to rapidly differentiate healthy versus diseased tissues.  There's a wealth of information in these raw signals and our approach reveals novel biomarkers that can be aligned with existing standards and categorization systems.  (And as our data - >2M pieces of data and growing is part of our IP - we're hard to copy.) Initially, we are targeting liver disease, a $30B global diagnostic market.
 
We have achieved over 93% AUROC for the OnX that detects liver fibrosis - and our 510K is in progress. Several follow-on liver products are in development.  We also have clinical data on other organ indications including prostate, kidney, breast and thyroid diseases and cancers.  We've been in discussion with several pharma companies and are moving forward on a pilot with Roche and have other traction in that space too.",http://oncoustics.com

Telling.ai,"Our lungs are the largest organ in our body and are constantly under attack. Over 500MM people globally suffer from a chronic lung disease and with COVID, pollution, smoke and heat many billions more are at risk because they lack the ability to easily monitor and detect the changes in their lung status outside of the clinic. It is vital for all of us to know how healthy our lungs are. 

Telling.ai answers the question by giving you a detailed lung health report by transforming the world’s smartphones into powerful respiratory monitoring devices that detect the changes in lung function to give patients the information needed to stay healthy and avoid hospitalization by listening to their speech.

How does it work? Just speak and we measure the gold standard lung function metrics

Telling.ai has developed a unique AI/ML audio processing infrastructure to develop vocal biomarkers. Our solution is available to any person in the world by just speaking into a smartphone, requiring no specialized hardware or sensors, to measure (1) FEV1 and FVC, the gold standard for understanding lung health and (2) Respiratory symptoms.

CryptoNext Security,"The quantum computer disruption is an opportunity, but also a threat to the security of our communications. A large-scale quantum computer will break the public key crypto-systems that secure Internet networks (https, IPSec VPN), mobile messaging apps (Signal, WhatsApp…), digital signature protocols, blockchain applications, etc…. The impact of this threat is systemic and all public and private organizations will have to migrate their IT infrastructure or products to quantum safe solutions.

National security agencies (NSA in USA, ANSSI in France, BSI in Germany...) deliver a common message: ""Quantum risk is simply too high and can no longer be ignored"". 

CryptoNext Security is a spin-off, from Inria, Sorbonne University and CNRS, founded in 2019 by Jean-Charles Faugère and Ludovic Perret, two mathematician researchers, pioneers in post quantum cryptography.

CryptoNext Security develops quantum resistant cryptography software solutions. The core technology of CryptoNext is a Quantum Safe Library (QSL) of public key cryptography.

CipherMode Labs,"CipherMode provides a cryptographic software-only solution that protects data during computation. Enterprises will be able to utilize their data while keeping it fully confidential with provable security guarantees. 

The CipherMode platform removes several obstacles in extracting the maximum value from enterprise data: Currently, enterprise data is fragmented, stored in different locations, and managed by isolated teams. Moreover, when information is distributed across different jurisdictions, it is governed by local regulations, which often conflict. Ad-hoc access-control policies for one-off use cases additionally hinder progress and innovation within organizations. The above obstacles lead to data underutilization. 

The CipherMode platform simplifies data workflow and increases efficiency as data can be stored and used securely without business risks. For instance, an enterprise can gather insights and perform data analytics on data stored in different jurisdictions without transferring unencrypted data to a central location. In addition to internal applications, CipherMode software allows collaboration with external entities without disclosing the data, e.g., multiple companies can collaborate and jointly train a better AI model without sharing their private data.",http://ciphermode.tech

ShareSmart,"ShareSmart is transforming the way healthcare professionals deliver care to patients via secure video and messaging.

The use of non-secure smartphone apps and video tech unsuitable for clinical collaboration and virtual health is a significant modern healthcare problem. The incidences of patient data breaches are increasing and are often due to a clinician’s smartphone or software being inadequately secured. 

Many clinicians began offering virtual health consultations during the pandemic and  are now suffering from COVID burnout. Legacy approaches to clinical photography, including bulky digital cameras, out-of-date fax machines, and difficult-to-access electronic medical record systems still forced many to go into the hospital when they didn't need to. The video technology they chose to implement resulted in an increase in patient no shows, overhead and inefficiency. Worse yet, these technologies paired with a reduction in in-person capacity during the pandemic introduced accessibility issues for the most vulnerable populations.

ShareSmart is where high tech begets a high touch approach, driving down the cost of care, improving patient outcomes, and enabling patients to become agents of their own health destiny.",http://sharesmart.ca
True Angle,"True Angle is a health tech company whose mission is to empower people to live better lives through smart technologies. Our first step in that mission is to help people living with dysphagia, the medical term for swallowing disorders, by empowering them with a remote exercise technology so that instead of being terrified of choking on food, or of needing a feeding tube, they can  get back to enjoying meals with their family and friends. To achieve this mission, True Angle took a costly, inconvenient, and inaccessible clinical machine used to treat swallowing disorders, and compacted it into an affordable, convenient, data-driven health@home technology. We called it the Mobili-T – or mobile therapist. The Mobili-T is a patented system that consists of a small wireless sensor that is supported by “smart” software that provides custom exercise targets and feedback, as well as daily adherence tracking, all of which can be shared with a clinician. This pocket-sized technology is empowering people to take charge of their health, rise above their swallowing disorders, and find joy in the life they are living.
