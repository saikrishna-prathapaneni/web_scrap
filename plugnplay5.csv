WarehouseBlueprint,"They were a team of industrial engineers, designing warehouse layouts for customers. They had to explain to clients the details of the warehouse layout frequently. Aside from the CAD software, they tried this other commercial tool to produce 3D warehouse layouts as well. The licensing fee was pricey and the learning curve was steep.

They were then introduced to SketchUp and their initial project using this software brought an ""awe-moment"" to the clients. They were delighted to see the new proposed changes to the current warehouse in three dimensional pictures.

Modeling the entire warehouse takes time, and the components from previous projects are required to be modified to be reused. In order to speed up the entire process, they have started to design various dynamic components.

The creation of these dynamic components allows us to complete a warehouse modeling in 3D within the shortest possible time. The idea is simple.

Pipra AG,"30% of patients aged over 60 suffer from cognitive impairment after surgery. Disorientation, memory loss, difficulty in speech, and behavioura changes are among the symptoms experienced by patients affected by Post-Operative Delirium (POD). These cognitive disorders result in longer post-surgical recovery time, with increased hospital stays and associated costs. In addition, the most severe forms of post-operative cognitive disorders can lead to admission in nursing homes, dementia and even death. 

After onset, POD cannot be treated. Instead, prevention can be very effective. By giving special care to high-risk patients, the incidence of POD is reduced.

This removes systemic collection bias and ensures that every plastic matters and is collected -  preventing plastics from entering the water bodies right at source. Valuable data from waste helps avert FMCG companies from making inaccurate/imprecise marketing decisions due to current data paucity/unreliability in India and abroad.

Poliloop,"We developed a microbial cocktail that degrades, metabolises and mineralizes fossil based plastics. Our process is applicable to all sorts of single-use plastics (PET, PP, LDPE, HDPE, PS, CPE, EVA -all tested) and can operate under suboptimal conditions.  we have tested these plastics separately and mixed in together as well. The listed plastics are post-consumer waste plastics: colored, clear, sterilized and plastics with food debris on them. This method not only solves the plastic issue but also generates valuable end-products: bioplastics and biogas. With these, our aim is to create a circular, thus more sustainable economy. The process itself can be described as follows: we take a blend of hydrocarbon based plastics, put them in a batch with the bacteria, our minimal essential media and water. Afterwards in about two days we can macroscopically confirm the beginning of the degradation process. Complete degradation of the polymers will take about two months.",http://www.poliloop.com

Intermix Performance Materials,"Our polymer additive enables the valorization of mixed plastics at low cost producing a high quality alloy.
 
Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) account for about 2/3 of all plastics in post-consumer waste. Due to their different structures, they are not miscible, resulting in plastic mixtures with unacceptably poor strength. One way to create higher quality recycled materials is to perform careful manual separation, but this is expensive and the separated materials still exhibit performance that is inferior to pure PP and PE unless separation is near perfect.
 
Intermix has developed a polymer additive that when added to a stream of mixed PP and PE enables these two polymers to be combined, yielding a polymer alloy that is mechanically comparable to pure PE and PP samples. This obviates laborious and expensive sorting.
