However, these agents are limited by:
a) Effectiveness — Up to 85% of patients fail such therapies, and are left with limited options. As these drugs become more prevalent, the incidence of resistant patients will increase.
b) High cost — the retail cost of IO drug combinations can be as high as $270,000 per year, with >10% of patients declaring personal bankruptcy. aPD-1 drug resistance is due to limited immune cell priming, trafficking and killing efficiency. These non-immunogenic tumors are ‘cold’ because of the lack of tumor inflammation. There are intense efforts to improve effectiveness of aPD-1 drugs by combining them with agents that drive infiltration of tumoricidal cells by turning ‘cold’ tumor to ‘hot.’ The leading approaches are expensive, systemically toxic, and must be administered intratumorally by an interventional radiologist through costly procedures, as only 10% of patients have accessible tumors.

In fact, 40% of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Despite cancer treatment including chemotherapy for 40-70% of patients, local or distant tumor recurrence through metastasis occurs at an alarming rate varying with cancers with 30% recurrence in breast cancer and nearly 100% recurrence for glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Tumor recurrence occurs due to the presence of a population of cancer cells that are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation, termed cancer stem cells. Moreover, cancer stem cells are highly tumorigenic and are also associated with cancer progression where they facilitate metastasis. Presently, there are no adjunct therapies on the market that effectively target and eradicate glioblastoma tumors, or importantly the cancer stem cells responsible for recurrence.

Their first and often only resistance response is to form ""biofilm"" -- a glue-like substance that shields the pathogen from antimicrobial biocides, antibiotics, and the immune systems of animals and humans.  Once formed, biofilm is extremely hard to remove, captures multiple species in the same biofilm, enabling horizontal gene transfer among species, and eventually sloughs off in air, water and on contact and transports the entire colony to new sites.  
As formulators of agroindustrial and consumer products increase the levels of antimicrobials used in order to curb bacterial and fungal degradation and contamination, the pathogens form thicker biofilm.  The toxic load on ecosystems and organisms from this exposure has created surging consumer demand for ""green"" alternatives.  Current natural and ""green"" alternatives, including silver and copper, cannot remove biofilm and are failing to control AMR contamination.
In healthcare, biofilm is associated with 90% of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), most chronic wounds and bacterial and fungal infections, and community-transmitted transmission (schools, playgrounds, marketplaces, food, etc.).

In 2019, 1.7 million people died from AMR infections, of which 24,000 were in the U.S. In April 2020, the CDC reported that 20% of COVID-19 deaths were due to contaminated catheters and respirators, representing over 50,000 deaths and counting.","Aequor discovered novel small molecules in the ocean that remove biofilm in minutes and prevent its formation for days, as well as kill a broad spectrum of AMR and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens alone and in combination with ineffective antibiotics (including Penicillin), ""potentiating"" them to work at sub-MIC doses.
Upon validating the efficacy of Aquor's primary natural chemical, Lonza stated: ""Nothing known can remove biofilm at non-toxic doses.""  
Aequor's portfolio of small molecules are divided by end-use:
--Novel natural chemicals are effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria and fungi, including mixed species oral flora bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, S. gordonii), A. baumannii carbapenem-R, S. enterica fluoroquinolone-R, E. coli carbapenem-R, P. aeruginosa carbapenem-R, S.aureus, MRSA, VRSA, MDR-Staph, Candida albicans, Candida auris, Aspergillus brasiliensis, etc.  These are earmarked as ingredients for formulators of consumer and agroindustrial products where the ""natural"" is desirable.  These require biosynthesis, scale-up and EPA/FIFRA regulatory approval.
--30 Novel synthesized analogs are earmarked as new drug candidates.  Aequor has reached Hit-to-Lead level with several of these, but they require chemical synthesis and scale-up before they can enter the FDA pipeline.  The NIH/NIAID and DOD/AMRIID offered Aequor free pre-IND trials for up to 9 new drug candidates (value $18M) because of their efficacy against AMR and MDR pathogens sent to Aequor by the CDC and NIH.  Aequor's subsidiary in the UK, Aequor Ltd., won a Horizon 2020 Phase I grant in the BioMed category for developing topical therapeutics for skin and soft tissue infections and wound care treatments.  Aequor missed Phase II by one point, allegedly because of Brexit, and is looking for a new location.
--40 synthesized analogs are already available at commercial scale (ton quantities) and 25 are approved under the EPA Toxic Substances Control Act, certified as non-toxic and ""green.""  These are Aequor's low hanging fruit.  In addition to selling ingredients to product formulators to replace toxic biocides, Aequor developed several proprietary end-use products:
     -water treatments. NASA was our first customer.  In a three-year project, one dose of Aequor's treatment removed biofilm and bacterial contamination from the water reuse/recycling system used on board the International Space Station for 15 months without replenishment.  For this Aequor won NASA's iTech Award and current accolades for work on the Moon and Mars Missions.
     -boosters for algae and yeast biomass used in biofuel and renewable biobased coproducts:  food (the meatless burger), animal feed, nutraceuticals, plastics, chemicals, etc. 
     -surface cleaners.  With EPA/FIFRA approval, we can make antimicrobial claims.  With FDA approval, we can sell cleaners for critical clinical surfaces.

The Company has three development programs targeting xCT: (1) an antibody-drug conjugate, (2), a conjugated radiopharmaceutical, and (3) AX09, a VLP-based therapeutic vaccine.","Numerous cancer types are highly resistant to traditional therapies due to oxidative stress induced by cancer cell metabolism. Oncogenic mutations of KRAS, KEAP1/NRF2, STK11, and LKB1 are frequent driver mutations in colorectal, breast, non-small cell lung (NSCLC), liver, and pancreatic cancers leading to metabolic changes and altered cellular signaling that can increase the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increases in ROS have been shown to drive tumor progression and resistance to treatment leading to poor overall survival. For example, NSCLC patients with KEAP1/NRF2 mutations have an overall median survival of 10 months vs. 24 months without the mutations regardless of treatment. Targeting redox-sensitive pathways and transcription factors offer great promise for cancer therapy","AgilVax has developed a patent-pending, antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), AX30, that targets the cystine-glutamate antiporter, xCT (SLC7A11). SLC7A11 is essential for initiating tumor formation and metastatic spread by reducing the oxidative stress in several oncogenic KRAS-mutant cancers, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, colorec¬tal adenocarcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. As a class, ADCs are experiencing a resurgence with several recent product approvals (Enhertu®, Tradelvy®, Padcev®) and new investment funding to develop novel ADCs. 
      
AgilVax has evaluated numerous ADCs with various linkers and payloads in murine tumor models using KRAS mutant cell lines and determined that pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers demonstrate the most potent in vivo activity.  More specifically, murine AX30 with a val-ala-PAB tesirine significantly reduced CT26 (Kras G12D) tumor volumes in BALB/c mice. Additionally, chimeric AX30 val-ala-PAB tesirine treatment of nude mice implanted with H460 (KRAS G13D) cells reduced tumor volume by 90% compared to control animals 21 days after the start of treatment. 

AX30 is well positioned for 2nd line (and later) therapy as a viable option for patients with progressive or drug resistant cancers. A clinical biomarker is available to identify suitable patients that overexpress xCT. A Phase I/II study is planned to support a FDA Fast Track designation with a goal of accelerated approval. According to GlobalData, the U.S. market is forecasted to be $6 billion by 2025 for 2nd line (and later) therapy in metastatic colorectal, HER2- breast, and NSCLC cancers providing a significant market opportunity. The development landscape includes glutamine inhibitors being studied in early clinical trials in combination with standard therapies for redox control.","ADCs, Antibody Drug Conjugate, Breast Cancer, Cancer Vaccine, Colon Cancer, KRAS, Lung Cancer, Vaccine","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/AgilVax,_Inc.","No","No",""

N95 filters block airborne COVID-19, harmful PM2.5 and other airborne viruses, bacteria, pollen and mold. But conventional N95 masks are ill-fitting, allowing contaminated air to leak into the masks from the edges. Conventional N95 masks have high breathing resistance, which makes them uncomfortable to wear, especially for children and seniors with reduced lung capacity. Conventional N95 masks use uncomfortable, ineffective nose wires and sticky foam strips to try to improve the mask’s seal against the wearer’s face. A one-size-fits-all harness used on conventional masks contributes to a poor fit and discomfort.","Air99 solves these problems with our patented, self-conforming Airgami design. The Airgami respirator masks create a better fitting, more comfortable, airtight seal without nose wires or sticky foam strips.

(2)	Addressing the high cost and time limitations of existing T-cell therapies expressing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) which we believe will continue to limit their commercial potential.","Ziopharm’s gene transfer technology, Sleeping Beauty, is the most clinically advanced nonviral gene transfer methodology. Clinical data from the associated first generation CD19-specific CAR-T trials suggests that Sleeping Beauty-modified CAR-T cells can be infused safely with minimal adverse side effects, persisting for as long as 4 years post treatment and providing patient benefit and. This approach uses DNA plasmids which has significant advantages compared to commercially-available CAR-T for CD19+ hematologic malignancies based on eliminating the need for costly and time-consuming production of virus to genetically modify T cells and lengthy time in culture to manufacture the CAR-T product. Ziopharm uses the Sleeping Beauty system to stably express a CD19-specific CAR as well as a derivative of IL-15 to infuse the product the day after gene transfer in a process termed rapid personalized manufacturing (RPM) technology. Preclinical data suggest the CAR+mbIL15+ T cells are efficacious, have a younger phenotype and persist longer in vivo compared to CAR+ T cells. Ziopharm has an open IND at MD Anderson Cancer center to test the CAR+mbIL15+ T cells using the RPM technology. The technology has the potential to be a solution for next-generation T-cell therapies, addressing the high cost of existing commercial CAR-T products.   The advantages of Sleeping Beauty are relevant for treatment of solid tumors where the complexity of targeting the disease arises not only from both intra- and inter- patient tumor antigen heterogeneity, but also the presentation of that antigen by the HLA complex.  Ziopharm believes its nonviral Sleeping Beauty platform is one of the only scalable gene transfer solutions for personalized TCR-T therapies. Viral manufacturing for TCRs on a patient-by-patient basis will simply be too costly to commercialize the targeting of neoantigens by TCR-T. In contrast, DNA plasmids from the Sleeping Beauty technology allows for manufacture of individualized TCRs against neoantigens unique to patients addressing the issue of inter-tumor variation (enabling multiple patients to be treated) and infusion of multiple TCRs per patient overcoming the issue of intra-tumor neoantigen heterogeneity with deleterious emergence of antigen-negative escape variants (leading to relapse). Ziopharm is currently moving forward with testing its platform in collaboration with Dr. Steve Rosenberg at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in a phase 2 clinical trial. The Company licensed a portfolio of TCRs against hotspot mutations from the NCI, specifically for TP53, RAS and EGFR mutations. Ziopharm plans to conduct clinical trial(s) for treatment of patients with solid tumors at MD Anderson Cancer Center with TCRs that are personalized for the patient’s unique mutations as well as TCRs from this library.  Finally, the company is developing technologies to harness pro-inflammatory cytokines for controlling immune cells. As mentioned above, Ziopharm’s membrane bound interleukin 15 (mbIL15) has been utilized with CAR-T to eliminate the need for ex vivo propagation of T cells. In addition, Ziopharm’s Controlled IL-12 platform provides therapy for solid tumors that inherently engender little or no immune system activity. The platform uses a replication-incompetent adenovirus encoding a genetic switch under control of a small molecule (termed veledimex) to conditionally express recombinant IL-12. Loco-regional expression of IL-12 turns “cold tumors hot” as made evident by the sustained infiltration of immune cells. The Company is developing IL-12 as a monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat brain cancer and are exploring its therapeutic potential in other solid tumors. Initial data demonstrated that patients with recurrent glioblastoma appear to have improved survival compared with historical controls and evidence of immune-mediated anti-tumor effects based on serial magnetic resonance imaging.","Solid tumors, Immunotherapy, T-cell, CAR-T","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Alaunos_Therapeutics_%28fka_ZioPharm_Oncology%29","No","No",""

With this understanding, we have devoted the last seven years to developing novel therapeutics that harness the brain’s immune system to treat neurodegeneration. Two of our lead assets are pursuing two neurodegenerative disorders, with many more in our pipeline: 

FTD is a rapidly progressing and severe form of dementia found most frequently in people less than 65 years old at the time of diagnosis. It affects 50,000 to 60,000 people in the United States and roughly 110,000 in the European Union. This devastating disease is characterized by increasingly inappropriate social behavior, lack of judgment, a loss of empathy and loss of inhibition leading gradually to death within 7-10 years after diagnosis. There are currently no approved treatments options available for FTD.  

Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, affecting over 5 million people in the United States alone. The disease is characterized by gradual mental deterioration, loss of memory and eventually death. There are currently no meaningful therapies approved to prevent, cure or meaningfully slow its progression.","Our discovery platform leverages human genetic datasets, advanced tools in bioinformatics and imaging, and insights in neurodegeneration and immunology to: (1) identify immune system targets that play a critical role in the development of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, and rapidly develop antibody therapeutics to these targets; (2) interrogate and prioritize those targets using biomarkers and related proprietary assays and preclinical models; and (3) clinically test product candidates in genetically defined patient populations that are most likely to respond to treatment.

This approach fails to classify the pain’s etiology or help guide a specific intervention. As a result, pain is often treated empirically, with drugs being used in a trial-and-error fashion leading to lack of efficacy, increased healthcare costs, unnecessary side effects, tolerance, and abuse—all pointing to the need for more objective assessment and better monitoring of the impact of analgesics. In pediatric populations, patient self-report is even more unreliable and often the caregiver contributes to the subjective reporting of pain.","Founded in 2015, AlgometRx Inc. is a digital health device startup spun out from Children’s National Hospital, Washington, DC, by Julia Finkel, MD, a pediatric anesthesiologist. The AlgometRx Nociometer is a novel device, that can objectively identify pain type, measure pain intensity, and monitor the impact of an analgesic intervention. The AlgometRx Nociometer® is a novel integration of infrared pupillometry and neuroselective neurostimulation. With this device, we are able to capture and quantify pupillary responses to an applied stimulus. The device uses innocuous neuroselective stimulation to evoke a pupillary dilation (nPRD) for each nerve type which is used to characterize nociceptive processing that occurs during pain. Nociception, the neural process of encoding and processing noxious stimuli, is the first step of the complex physiological process which ultimately leads to experience of pain and is a component of pain that is the target of analgesic pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. The AlgometRx Nociometer measures pupil dilation in response to neuroselective stimulation, allowing for the objective assessment of pain type and quantification of pain intensity. The decision support provided by this technology enables the clinician to more accurately diagnose, select analgesic type and dose, and monitor effectiveness without relying entirely on feedback from the patient. Of course, for non-verbal patients, such as neonates or the unconscious, there is no feedback so the value of this technology is significant. However, the need for this technology extends beyond non-verbal patients.

We are the creators of the Photonanotherapy™ (PNT) platform - a receptor targeted nanoparticle based treatment, with the potential for broad application in oncology. PNT achieves treatment specificity through molecular targeting of key receptors and a controlled photochemical (photodynamic) mechanism of rapid cell destruction. Initially we plan to exploit PNT in two specific areas:

•	As a safe intra-operative procedure in the resection and treatment of glioblastoma – providing the surgeon with a tool that can “go where the scalpel” cannot – killing cancerous cells “embedded” in surrounding healthy tissue
•	In MR Imaging of solid tumors – we are able to directly image the nanoparticle via MRI (not a contrast agent) – this will provide the first non-metal (paramagnetic) based MR Imaging agent (combined with the first bullet this offers the very real prospect of a theranostic reagent – able to both image and treat a tumor at the same time

PNT is a broad treatment platform, it can image, target and kill specific cell types and can be “tuned” to selectively treat a wide variety of cancers. PNT achieves treatment specificity through molecular (peptide based) targeting of defined cells/receptors, together with a controlled photochemical mechanism of cell destruction. This strategy delivers maximal efficacy while minimizing side-effects common with current alternatives.
PNT has the potential to change the therapeutic landscape for MR Imaging and many key and difficult to treat cancers. With a much broader view PNT  offers opportunity for use into cardiac, ophthalmic, infectious disease and other therapeutic markets..","Glioblastoma – is a disease with a grim prognosis. The standard of care is surgical resection (if possible) followed by chemo and/or radiotherapy. Due to the morphology of the glioblastoma it is effectively impossible to “resect to the tumor limit” and microscopic “roots” of tumor cells penetrate into the surrounding healthy tissue. In almost all cases this results in rapid re-growth of the tumor – the median post-operative survival rate is about 15 months, with less that 10% surviving 5 years. Only small improvements have been made in the last 20 years. (NB – an apparent obvious target for Immunotherapy – however it is highly questionable as to if antibodies cross the blood brain barrier).

MR Imaging – growing in excess of 5% per year MRI is a key tool in the diagnosis of a wide variety of tumors – MRI images the water present in the tissue. To improve contrast (fidelity) of this image to better de-lineate structures Contrast Agents are used – in almost all cases these are paramagnetic [metal] based complexes – those containing gadolinium (Gd3+) represent the vast majority. There are two specific problems:

•	Certain Gd3+ linear complexes are now known to leave deposits of Gd in tissues and on repeated dosing this accumulates and may be related to long term nerve/muscle dysfunction – there is a very clear need for reagents NOT based on paramagnetic complexes
•	The is always a need for higher contrast and fidelity – typically MRI is good to a few mm – and thus cannot diagnose very early stage or “diffuse” tumors – providing a reagent that pushes this limit is clearly required and desired by the market

NOTE – the MR Imaging agent and the PNT agent for Glioblastoma – rely on the same nanoparticle and targeting peptide – the ONLY difference is in the addition of a Photosensitizer for the PNT treatment (even so the full system can also be MR Imaged)","PNT is the fusion of the best elements of five separate proven and practiced technologies. Each is the result of multi-million-dollar investment over many years at leading academic and commercial institutions. Management believes this strategy significantly mitigates the risk of technical and clinical failure, while shortening the development timeline essentially to that required to meet regulatory requirements.

PNT is a broad treatment platform, it can be used to image, target and kill specific tumors. PNT achieves treatment specificity through molecular targeting of the tumor, together with a controlled photochemical mechanism of cell destruction. This strategy delivers maximal efficacy while minimizing side-effects common with current alternatives.
PNT is a combination treatment, comprising two elements:
•	A tissue targeted nanoparticle carrying a photoactivated molecule - delivered via intravenous infusion, the nanoparticle attaches to, and accumulates in the targeted tissue.
•	A laser device and light diffusers - deliver light to the treatment site.  This is low energy near infra-red (NIR) light. 

The NIR light activates the photoactive molecule, triggering the drug’s pharmacological action, resulting in rapid, targeted cell death, without damaging healthy surrounding tissue (neither the light nor the nanoparticle alone causes any cell damage, both are required). 
PNT is intended as a single dose treatment, but, if required may be repeated without issue. Uniquely, once administered the nanoparticle has the potential to be imaged (through MRI and for diagnosis alone, without the need for light), used for treatment alone (with light), or in tandem as a “see and treat” (Theranostic) platform.  
PNT integrates several separate leading-edge and individually proven medical technologies. Specifically, the “kill” mechanism is an FDA approved and practiced first-line and palliative treatment for several cancer indications. This original technology (photodynamic therapy or PDT) is highly effective, however, it has experienced slow market adoption, due to its non-targeting of tissue and low potency first-generation drugs, which have significant dosage and post-treatment issues. PNT directly addresses these self-limiting shortcomings.
There is extensive human clinical data supporting the safety and effectiveness of the core pharmacological behavior – the photodynamic effect, already exploited in Photodynamic therapy (PDT). In addition, there is a large body of preclinical research data demonstrating the safety, targeting and improved efficacy of the PNT system for both cardiac and cancer indications. A summary of these key points for the individual elements of, and the PNT nanoparticle are shown in  Table 1 below. 
Table 1 – Key Points – Individual Elements and the Assembled Nanoparticle

In summary PNT is:
•	A treatment platform with application across a broad range of therapeutic segments.
•	Highly effective – with a proven/approved mechanism of pharmacological action.
•	Specific – biologically targeted to kill only the desired cell type (tissue).
•	Low risk – with an absence of non-specific systemic side effects and little to no scarring. 
•	Versatile – it may be used in concert with other procedures (surgery) or as a first-line treatment.
•	Theranostic – ultimately able to both image and treat at the same time

PNT is protected through the exercise of options to exclusively license intellectual property, assembled by working with world-leading research institutions and business partners. These exclusive rights relating to nanoparticles, cell targeting vectors and photochemistry will provide both operating companies with exclusive rights to PNT in their respective markets.","Oncology, Photonanotherapy, PNT, MRI, PDT, Nanoparticle, Nanomedicine","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Allumeros_BioScience_LLC","No","No",""

Extracellular HSP70 is central to antigen delivery to the immune system. Specifically, free HSP70, or HSP70 bound to extracellular vesicles or peptide antigens, exerts immune stimulatory effects on many immune effector cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and macrophages. Its role is especially crucial in chaperoning tumor-derived (or autoreactive) antigens to DCs, which capture, process, and present tumor antigens to initiate the development of immune responses against all cancers (or self-antigens). Antibodies that target extracellular HSP70-peptide complexes and modulate antigen presentation may represent novel therapies for the treatment of cancer or autoimmune diseases.","Presentation of antigens to the immune system is a fundamental mechanism of immunity, which is essential for the development of vigorous adaptive immune responses. In the tumor microenvironment, the presentation of tumor antigens to antigen-presenting dendric cells (DCs) is suppressed, thereby aiding and abetting tumor cell survival and precluding the development of robust anti-tumor immune responses. Suppression of antigen presentation and DC function contributes in many tumor types to either a blunting or complete abrogation of activity by immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Stimulation of tumor antigen presentation represents a promising novel approach to the activation of anti-tumor immune responses either alone or in combinations with ICIs. Enhanced antigen presentation also likely to stimulate immune responses to therapeutic vaccines.
Conversely, immune responses to self-antigens lead to the development of autoimmune diseases, and thus, inhibition of self-antigen presentation may represent a rational approach to suppress autoimmunity.","Asylia’s lead antibody, ASY-77A, selectively binds to extracellular HSP70-tumor antigen complexes and promotes their uptake by DCs, resulting in DC activation and antigen presentation.

Unfortunately, the current approach is to spend billions of dollars re-designing and re-developing new variant-specific countermeasures each time a new resistant viral variant evolves. The problem is that there is no way to design, clinically test, FDA-authorize, manufacture, and administer new vaccines or therapeutics faster than a highly transmissible aerosolizable virus can spread. Omicron caused a global pandemic in 2 weeks. The only way to secure the nation against the next viral threats—whether natural or engineered—is to develop variant-proof countermeasures before the next threats emerge. Further, given that many pathogens are transmitted before individuals even know that they are infected, any broad-spectrum countermeasure needs to be prophylactically safe to curtail pandemic spread.","Autonomous has developed a new class of RNA to enable resistance-proof protection against any variant of a virus. Known as encrypted RNA™, these platform-derived countermeasures are next-generation, ‘smart’ RNAs that only activate to confer broad-spectrum efficacy upon infection by a targeted virus. Encrypted RNAs are thus designed to be safe and inert when administered to healthy individuals. As a result, a single encrypted RNA dose can confer efficacy against any variant of a viral pathogen, both therapeutically and prophylactically.

As a result, these byproducts accumulate to toxic levels in the body’s cells and, in turn, disrupt the function of multiple tissues and organs. Today, many of these diseases – including Fabry disease, Gaucher disease and Pompe disease – are primarily managed by bi-weekly, multi-hour infusions with enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs) that seek to exogenously replace the missing enzyme. However, given the characteristics of most ERTs, they typically only remain in the plasma for a short period of time and thus are not ideal because they are only dosed every two weeks. These existing therapies manage, rather than cure, the underlying diseases and, as a result, the diseases continue to progress. Further, the frequent, periodic and life-long dosing schedule required for ERTs results in significant costs for the healthcare system and is burdensome for the patient.","AVROBIO’s gene therapies are designed to transform a patient’s own cells into a drug product that enables the patient to express functional enzyme or other protein and mirror the biology seen in an otherwise healthy individual.

"Axonova Medical","JPOD @ Philadelphia (Philadelphia)","Alumni","","","Pharmaceuticals","Neuroscience","Platform","Neuronal Growth","MedTech","Orthopaedics","Trauma",,"Peripheral nerve grafts.","For patients requiring surgical reconstruction of a peripheral nerve following traumatic injury, only 50% will achieve good to normal restoration of function, regardless of the repair strategy.  Moreover, full functional recovery is considered impossible for major PNI – those injuries in which a large segment of a nerve is lost (i.e., ?5 cm) or more proximal injuries (e.g., brachial plexus) that require long distances for axonal regeneration to distal targets (e.g., hand).  As such, civilians and warfighters who experience major PNI face the high probability of a residual functional deficit, even following state-of-the-art surgical reconstruction. For some, the deficit will be significant, debilitating and life altering (e.g., flail/nonfunctional arm or hand; decreased mobility; facial palsies impacting speech or eating).  Often, some patients will elect to have a salvaged limb amputated once it becomes obvious that nerve regeneration, and hence the ability to feel and control the limb, will not occur.  The inadequacy of current PNI repair options stems from the failure to overcome the long regenerative distances and times necessary to reinnervate distal targets.  When a nerve is cut or deformed (i.e. stretched or crushed) such that axonal integrity is compromised, the axonal segment distal to the injury site rapidly degenerates – an inevitable consequence of being disconnected from its cell body. To restore function, axon regeneration must not only occur across the gap between the proximal and distal nerve stumps, but also through the entire distal nerve segment to end targets. Thus, PNI repair is ultimately a race against time, where long regenerative distances and slow axonal rates of regeneration (~1mm/day) create prolonged periods of denervation that negatively impact the capacity for axon regeneration as well as the ability of distal nerve structures to support regeneration.  Prolonged periods of denervation also negatively impact end targets and will ultimately and irrevocably render muscle unresponsive to reinnervation.  To overcome the inherent limitations of current reconstructive options for PNI, there is a critical need for products that can simultaneously (1) promote axogenesis across the nerve gap (site of injury) into the distal nerve structure to establish and maintain a contiguous regenerative pathway for axons from the site of injury to muscle (referred to as “bridging”), and (2) maintain the overall pro-regenerative capability and innervation capacity of denervated target muscle for subsequent reinnervation by regenerating axons (referred to as “babysitting”).","Axonova Medical and its founders at the University of Pennsylvania are developing proprietary tissue engineered nerve grafts (TENGs) as a “living scaffold” for PNI repair.  To our knowledge, TENGs are the only technology capable of providing both bridging and babysitting functions for the reconstruction of peripheral nerves.  As such, TENGs represent a potential transformative solution for functional repair of major PNI.    TENGs are living three-dimensional nerve constructs that consist of longitudinally aligned, bundled axonal tracts spanning discrete neuronal populations. TENGs are fabricated in custom mechanobioreactors where integrated axon tracts of 5-10cm can be created in 14-21 days with no theoretical limit as to the final length.  These axon tracts endow TENGs with a unique mechanism of action for the co-regeneration of nerve and muscle that, to our knowledge, cannot be replicated by other tissues, cells and/or biomaterials.  To date, we have achieved preclinical proof of concept for TENGs as both a living bridge and babysitter in rat and pig models of PNI.    To date, we have we have shown that allogeneic and xenogeneic TENGs are a vastly superior bridging strategy compared to commercially available nerve guidance conduits and acellular nerve allografts and, at a minimum, are as effective as autografts for functional repair of large lesions.  This includes recent data in a porcine model of PNI where we have shown that TENGs can reproducibly and robustly repair 5cm lesions in a critical motor nerve that is >20cm from distal end targets.  In both rats and pigs, we demonstrated that host axons “latch” on to and rapidly grow along TENG axons to cross a nerve gap, thereby mimicking key mechanisms of nervous system development (in a process we refer to “axon-facilitated axon regeneration” or “AFAR”).  In a recent breakthrough, we have also shown that TENGs are the first strategy capable of maintaining the distal pathway in a pro-regenerative state for prolonged periods.  By virtue of its axons, TENGs integrate with otherwise denervated host Schwann cells to prevent their degeneration and maintain a pro-regenerative alignment over time, thereby increasing the window for long distance axonal regeneration and reinnervation of distal end targets.   We have also shown that TENGs form connections to otherwise denervated muscle and prevent atrophy while ensuring a more robust muscle recovery upon arrival of regenerating host axons.    Alongside efficacy, we completed initial safety studies with allogeneic and xenogeneic TENGs in both rats and pigs.  In these studies, TENGs were proven to be safe and well tolerated.  Axonova has yet to determine if TENGs are immunologically privileged or simply shielded from the host immune system by a rapid regenerative response.","Regenerative Medicine, Translational Medicine, Nervous System Repair, Neuroscience, Peripheral Nerves","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Axonova_Medical","No","No",""

This means that compared with their own mothers, American women today are 50% more likely to die in childbirth. And the risk is consistently three to four times higher for black women than white women, irrespective of income or education. Additionally, for every death, pregnancy-related conditions, such as high blood pressure or blood clotting disorders, result in up to 100 severe injuries. For every severe injury, tens of thousands of women suffer from inadequately treated physical or mental illnesses, as well as the broader disempowerment mothers face in the absence of paid parental leave policies and other social support. The root cause of these startling statistics is often misunderstood. The public image of maternal death is a woman who has a medical emergency like a hemorrhage while in labor. However, very few deaths counted in maternal mortality statistics occur during childbirth. Rather, four out of five of these deaths happen in the weeks and months before or after birth. So, they occur not in the hospital, but in our communities. And they represent many failures — not just unsafe medical care, but also eroding social support necessary for women to recognize medical warning signs, like abnormal bleeding or hopelessness about the future, and to seek timely care. A few days after having a baby, American women are sent home from the hospital, infant in hand. Often, mother and family are left on their own until a cursory 15-minute visit with a healthcare provider several weeks later. During long gaps between checkups, mothers experience deep worry for their infants. They struggle with rapidly accelerated responsibilities, extreme sleep deprivation, and relentless pressure to return to work. And all while recovering from pregnancy and adjusting to parenthood — a transition that marks one of life’s greatest physiological endurance tests.

Our bionanotechnology is characterized by functionalizing ice nucleating enzymes into different materials making this enzyme more resilient to temperature changes. This way we can create a coolant that can freeze up to 4ºC, remain frozen until 84 hours with the right insulating material and at the same time being sustainable with the environment since it can be disposed as plant fertilizer. With this bionanotechnology NanoFreeze can create cold chain equipment like coolant products and returnable and non-returnable systems. All of the solutions use the bionanotech coolant to extend refrigerating cycles until 84 hours and this way enlarge the shelf life of the perishable products that are being transported.

Between NanoFreeze coolant products there are ice packs, cold coats and panels, all of them uses bionanotechnoogy in order to have the same cooling benefits. Additionally, NanoFreeze also creates refrigerated containers and cold packages which are foldable in order to optimize freight and space when the equipment its empty. These containers are made to bring a solution that can provide cold chain stability to transport biologics, medicines, chemicals or food during long journeys without requiring a cold cabin. With an integrated solution like NanoFreeze containers and cold packages it will be possible to give rural populations access to immunization, reaching further regions that currently are unattainable with the existing cold chain technologies.","The water regularly freezes at 0ºC with the presence of ice nucleating particles which can be dust, pollen or bacteria. However, without any ice nucleating particle, water must be placed at a temperature of -41ºC in order to freeze.

This number is expected to rise rapidly in the next few years due to a globally ageing population. According to Alzheimer’s association, AD has incurred a socioeconomic cost of approximately $305 billion in the US alone in 2020 and this value is predicted to reach $1.1 trillion in 2050. These values highlight the urgent need to intervene and manage AD through the discovery of early diagnosis and disease-modifying strategies.","? BIORCHESTRA strives to provide a solution through a disease-modifying therapy that will reverse AD pathogenesis and permanently halt AD progression as well as the development of an easily accessible, non-invasive diagnostic method that will facilitate early AD diagnosis. Specifically, BIORCHESTRA has found an epigenetically overexpressed microRNA in the brain of AD patients and has discovered its strong association with AD pathogenesis in preclinical models. The expression levels of this microRNA in salivary exosomes has shown strong predictive accuracy at differentiating between amyloid PET positive and negative patients, which is the current golden standard of AD diagnosis. Thus, we have developed a real-time PCR kit that is expected to serve as a non-invasive, patient-friendly diagnostic method that will facilitate early diagnosis of AD. 

? We have also found that through the regulation of this microRNA with the use of an anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO), we may be able to treat AD. By epigenetically modifying old and dysfunctional brain cells into young and healthy ones, our ASO not only removes misfolded protein pathologies but also improves neuroinflammatory and neuro-restoration processes as well as cognitive functions. In contrast to conventional treatment methods that exclusively target misfolded proteins, our ASO simultaneously modulates multiple AD-related pathological processes and, thereby has demonstrated potential to be used as a disease-modifying therapy in AD.

? The successful development of CNS disease therapies has been hindered due to difficulties associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Especially, RNA-based drugs like ASOs are highly unstable in the bloodstream and have low BBB penetration rate and, thereby have been commonly administered via highly invasive procedures, such as intrathecal administration as in the case with IONIS’s Spinraza and IONIS/BIOGEN’s tau-targeting IONIS-MAPTRx. To solve this problem, BIORCHESTRA has developed a brain-specialized DDS to allow the intravenous administration and clinically meaningful delivery of our ASO into the brain. Using our DDS, our ASO has shown to reach the intra-brain cells without any side-effects at a world-record of 7%, thus, our DDS is expected to serve as a high-end platform in the field of CNS-targeting drug delivery of RNA-based drugs.","Anti sense oligonucleotide, microRNA, mRNA, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, BBB drug delivery system, Central nerve system","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Biorchestra","Yes","No",""

Clinical trials mainly fail because a) the addressed drug target turns out to be not central to the disease mechanism and b) the wrong patients are selected for clinical trials. One way to improve the success rates is through genetic biomarkers gained from the analysis of existing biomedical data for drug target linkage and, more importantly, for patient stratification. But there is a caveat: biomedical data are difficult to analyze due to their structure of small sample sizes and many features (so-called high- dimensionality). Most current genetic biomarkers rely on single gene variants are thus limited in their predictive power. Because many diseases come into place due to complex interactions of multiple gene variants, it seems reasonable to strive towards polygenic biomarkers. However, the problematic nature of biomedical data (high- dimensionality: small sample size, many features) makes the discovery of polygenic markers most difficult.","Existing single gene biomarkers are limited in their impact mainly because diseases are caused by complex interactions of many genes. We find these complex interactions and derive polygenic interactions. There is a common question of what do we do with this biomarker, only if there is a solution of curing the disease.

Specifically, blood transfusion is commonly used to replace blood loss due to surgery, injury, or an illness in more than 4.5 million patients in Canada and the United States each year. Blood typing tests are performed to evaluate the compatibility of the donor red blood cells (RBCs), plasma, or platelets with the transfusion recipient, so as to ensure their body can safely accept the donated blood cells. According to medical practitioners from the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, the core-lab facilities in the hospital can provide the data that is needed, but they often cannot provide it quickly enough. In emergency scenarios, the lack of immediate pre-transfusion compatibility testing means that only products from “universal blood donors” (eg., group O RBCs and AB plasma) can be transfused. These products are in chronic short-supply and inventory levels often fall below target levels at Canadian Blood Services. As most patients actually have blood groups that do not necessitate the exclusive use of group O RBCs or AB plasma, the availability of a rapid, point-of-care-test for ABO group would greatly decrease the demand for these scarce blood products. In addition, the ability to rapidly identify patients who are RhD-positive would also decrease the reliance on RhD-negative RBCs, which are often transfused preferentially to individuals of unknown RhD-status so as to prevent the development of anti-D antibodies implicated in both delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Currently, blood typing tests for transfusion purposes are exclusively performed using processing units with large footprints (which cannot be deployed by the patient) and long turnaround times (minimum 20 minutes, on average > 40 minutes). 
Here is where Blue Ocean Technologies comes, with innovative microfluidic systems that are small and portable, aims to bring commonly ordered tests (blood grouping, hematocrit, coagulation, and others) to the bedside, greatly reducing the time from sample to result while providing the same high quality of the core laboratory tests.","Our solution relies on the use of a unique microfluidic technology dubbed digital microfluidics (DMF). DMF enables the manipulation of discrete nanoliter liquid droplets without the need for pumps or valves. In parallel, DMF can easily be paired with a wide range of sensors allowing for a plethora of assays to be miniaturized down to the size of a small shoe box while maintaining lab quality results. Additionally, by harvesting the power of microfluidics, assays can be expedited and along with the digital nature of DMF all steps of the protocol can be automated making our DMF platforms ideal for environments that need reliable, fast results with only the press of a button.  
The application of DMF for blood group typing has been protected in PCT/CA2020/050592 and forms the basis for the first product on deck for Blue Ocean Technologies. The tests require small volumes of blood sample (~5-15 ?L) and reagents (~5-7 ?L) and are implemented in a portable, battery-powered system that provides test results in 6 min, by simulating conventional laboratory assays using pre-programmed droplet movements. ABO and RhD blood types are determined by the clumping of cells, known as agglutination, which occurs when an antigen found on red blood cells is mixed with its corresponding antibody [Sensors, 2016, 16, 51]. Agglutination results are recorded via image capture and automatically interpreted using our custom artificial intelligence-driven image processing tools. As a result, the patient’s ABO (A, B, AB, or O) and RhD group (positive or negative) can be rapidly determined, and the most appropriate blood products can be selected for transfusion. Critically, no user interpretation or intervention is required for the new system – the entire process is automated and compatible with modern (wireless) laboratory information management systems (LIMS). Most importantly, in preliminary studies at SunnyBrook Hospital in which the prototype system was operated by untrained medical personnel, results generated using the new method had perfect concordance with results generated using gold-standard techniques [Clin. Chem. 2021, 67, 1699–1708].","blood typing, blood grouping, crossmatching, pre-transfusion compatibility testing, digital microfluidics","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Blue_Ocean_Technologies,_Inc.","No","No",""

Our mission is to empower people with a simple breath test that provides early detection of cancer and other diseases. Our focus is non-small cell lung cancer, the deadliest cancer in the world. Breathe BioMedical has completed a proof-of-concept study demonstrating our technology’s ability to detect non-small cell lung cancer with an accuracy of 86.1%.","Many cancers and diseases are discovered late in disease progression when it is difficult or impossible to treat. Early diagnosis is key to treating disease, saving lives, and reducing the global healthcare burden. Many current cancer screening techniques are inaccessible, invasive, and fail to identify the disease in the early stages.  Lung cancer, the deadliest cancer in the world, kills more people than colorectal, pancreatic and breast cancer combined. Furthermore, nearly 80% of patients are diagnosed at a late stage when the cancer is too advanced to be treated successfully. Current screening for lung cancer is done by imaging with technologies such as Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Despite coverage for annual screening, only 14% of the 14.5M high-risk Americans are getting screened. CT scans are costly and have a high number of false positives.  The number one reported reason for not getting screened is difficulty with travel between home and a testing site. Since CT scanners are scarce and fixed in their operating location, many patients must travel great distances. Although screening programs for other cancers like breast, colorectal, ovarian, and cervical are more successful in screening rates, they require highly invasive tests to detect the disease.","Breathe BioMedical (BBM) has developed a non-invasive and accessible breath test that screens for disease. Breath screening is an accurate, accessible, non-invasive, easy-to-use and convenient method to detect disease. At Breathe BioMedical we believe that Breath is the next biofluid for the early detection of disease.  Compared to traditional screening methods such as blood panel, colonoscopy, pap test, mammogram and CT scan, breath screening will save money, time, and lives through the early detection of disease. Our goal is to make screening for disease as easy as breathing. 

We have completed a proof-of-concept study demonstrating our technology's ability to detect non-small cell lung cancer with an accuracy of 86.1%. Evidence shows that many other cancers and diseases can be detected in the breath. We have completed two additional independent pilot studies, demonstrating high accuracy in the detection of early-stage breast cancer and COVID-19 pneumonia.  

Breathe BioMedical’s technology is comprised of the following three components: 

The Breath Sampler 
The BBM breath sampler, SohnoXB™, is uniquely designed to capture breath biomarkers  (VOCs) from exhaled breath inside a thermal desorption tube or sorbent tube for short. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are metabolites that are released into the lungs' alveolar air sacs from the bloodstream during carbon dioxide and oxygen gas exchange. These VOCs can then be detected in a person’s exhaled breath. As certain diseases progress, there are measurable changes in the composition and concentration of VOCs within the breath.  

Our SohnoXB device is a Class 1 medical device listed with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Breathe BioMedical has received a Medical Device Establishment License (MDEL) from Health Canada (HC). Our device has multiple patents and applications pending,  The SohnoXB breath sampler is the best in class due to its ability to collect exclusively alveolar breath (breath from the deepest part of the lungs), which is optimal for disease detection.  

The Spectrometer 
Our spectrometer uses Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) to measure the influence of biomarkers in breath samples which we collect using our breath sampler device (SohnoXB). BBM’s spectrometer works by introducing a gas sample into an optical cavity that is then probed with a sequence of laser pulses. BBM is the only company in the world that uses CRDS technology for breath analysis which provides exceptional sensitivity not available elsewhere. BBM’s spectrometer is both fast and powerful, permitting sample analysis down to parts-per-trillion levels. The data set which results from this highly sensitive measurement is then analyzed using machine learning to identify the patterns of disease biomarkers. 

The Machine Learning Algorithm  
The absorption spectra generated from the CRDS are processed using BBM’s proprietary software. Using machine learning algorithms, the program is capable of differentiating between the breath of diseased patients and that of healthy individuals. 

Breathe BioMedical’s breath test is proving to be an accurate, accessible solution for lung cancer screening with the potential for a broad range of screening applications down the road. Our accessible and compact breath test will allow our sampler to be placed in pharmacies, doctors' offices, and clinics. This non-invasive and fast screening test has the potential to provide unprecedented access to screening for patients around the world.

Most incubators also incorporate means for controlling relative humidity.

While current high-end infant incubators with full functionality are very expensive (capital equipment), more affordable models lack many important and impactful functionalities. Traditional incubators are stationary, have high electrical demand, are complex to clean and have a high risk of infant infection, and most importantly need higher nurse-to-infant ratio. With these technical and financial constraints, there is a low inclination to buy and keep neonatal incubators running; especially in Critical Access Hospital (CAH) and Acute Care Hospitals (ACH) where nurses face even more stress and scarce resources.

High costs and scarcity of NICU facilities ($3,000/day) hinder efforts to keep infant mortality low, especially in poor and rural areas of the United States. Over 22,000 infants died in 2017, mainly minorities in economically depressed communities. The leading causes are prematurity and low birth weight. The latter are almost 40 times more likely to die in the neonatal period; and almost 200 times greater for very low birth weight newborns. Fewer neonatal care units mean less access to expert nursing care and fewer incubators (capital equipment), correlating with higher infant mortality and morbidity. A study has identified that people living in communities with lower than $50,000 annual household income, or with less than 30% of residents with college diplomas, were more likely to be farther from the nearest hospital with advanced neonatal care units. Rural hospitals are facing financial difficulties, which forced about 100 birthing facilities to close to close in recent years.","Our goal is to continue the development of our patented (one granted, and several in progress) neonatal intensive incubator, NICI (510k class II) all-in-one disposable infant incubator platform, which redefines the traditional infant incubator and differs by: 1) usability: (disposable one week lifecycle housing), 2) weight, size and cost: (1% - non capital equipment), 3) electricity consumption: (12-volt from any source, grid or not), 4) functions and innovations: (heat, humidity, phototherapy, ventilation, containment, and vitals) - in addition future development of AI and IoMT.

Our unique NICI™ will be the first fully-functional, mobile, and disposable critical care incubator with a low-cost for use in hospitals. NICI is proposed as an essential medical device for providing important life support functions and monitoring which can be deployed in any healthcare context (rural, central, transport).

NICI is a fast-deploying, ruggedized, and frame-reinforced incubator created to provide reliable sophisticated functions that correspond to today’s standard of care. NICI will have four parts: 1) a disposable and lightweight frame-reinforced housing to create a fully functional enclosure with a one week lifecycle, 2) a touchscreen smart 12-volt controller with WiFi/IoT/data capability that can run on converted electricity (i.e. grid, solar, vehicle), 3) integrated heating and humidity systems, and 4) portable phototherapy with potential smart telemetry systems.

These necessary life support and monitoring functions in a regulated microenvironment coupled with future automated data collection can help in reducing costs and increasing access by informing governments and decision makers of best practices and standards of care. Additionally, the complexity we face as nurses to buy, maintain and move incubators has hindered access and decreased efficiency in NICU practices around the world.","Neonatal Incubator, biocontainment","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Breegi_Scientific","Yes","No",""

Surgical repair holds the two ruptured ends of tissue in close proximity, but the actual mending of fibers is solely dependent on the patient’s biology and their capacity to heal. The extraordinarily high retear rate is a clear indication that current approaches are failing to meet the needs of the patient. 

At BrilliantStrings Therapeutics, we help patients with orthopedic injuries by providing regenerative medicine products that rapidly integrate, lift the healing burden, and restore the pre-injury lifestyle. We are passionate about accelerated healing because orthopedic injuries are persistent, degenerative, and impact a patient’s long-term physical, mental, and economic health. Alleviating these conditions offers fuller quality of life, a return to hobbies, the opportunity to continue self-providing, and reduced stress and anxiety.

We focus on repair of connective tissues that incur damage from overuse and inadequate healing. Our first intervention point is positioned at the lower end of the tissue damage spectrum, which highlights micro-damage, tendinopathy, and small tears. These conditions are typically not indicated for open surgery and have no clinical solution to reverse or even stop degenerative progression. While early stage degeneration presents as the largest unmet need, our technology also has the potential to address the full spectrum of tissue damage. We anticipate seamlessly augmenting the existing surgical procedures to improve patient outcomes.","BrilliantStrings has developed a minimally invasive approach to both accelerate orthopedic repair and enhance the extent of healing for damaged tendons and ligaments. We directly provide collagen molecules, the dominant structural protein, to the injury, via ultrasound-guided injection. Over the course of two decades of academic research, we have demonstrated that extracellular matrix proteins are encoded to automatically grow and repair tissue, regardless of whether the proteins are cell-secreted or exogenously provided. This body of work and novel shift in thinking opens the door to a new class of protein therapeutics. The caveat is that the proteins must be allogeneic (same species) to function as nature intended and avoid immunogenesis. This means it is necessary to use human collagen to treat human injuries effectively. Using allogeneic collagen, our animal studies show a 150% strength increase over natural healing.","orthopedics, accelerated healing, collagen, CRISPR, mechano-therapeutic","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/BrilliantStrings_Therapeutics","Yes","No",""

"CAIRA Surgical","JLABS @ NYC (New York City)","Current Resident","","","MedTech","Orthopaedics","Platform","Robotic Surgery",,,,,"A robotic navigation platform that uses AI to optimize implant positioning.","Surgical navigation and robotic systems for joint replacement are costly, complex and invasive. They are dependent on legacy technology that is misaligned with the cost, efficiency and patient outcome challenges posed by the dramatic acceleration in demand for joint replacement worldwide.  In 2017, there were 1.2 million joint replacement procedures in the United States, comprising ~58.5% of worldwide procedure volume. In less than a decade, by 2026, joint replacement procedure volume is projected to increase 44% to 2.6 million procedures annually in the US alone.  A rapidly aging population, rising obesity rates and decreasing average age for joint replacement are among the forces accelerating demand.  Coincident with increasing demand, healthcare systems worldwide face acute pressure to decrease cost at each stage of care, especially those costs resulting from poor patient outcomes and revision surgery.  Rates of patient dissatisfaction reach 20% for total knee replacement (Dunbar MJ, Et.al. Bone Joint J. 2013), and the cost burden for revision of failed joint replacement procedures in the US is forecast to be $13bn annually by 2030 (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, 2010).   Joint replacement urgently needs comprehensive technology solutions that decrease cost, create procedural efficiencies and improve patient outcomes.      Incumbent systems are prohibitively expensive for the majority of hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers (ASC’s) performing joint replacement surgery. All systems require a capital expenditure ranging from $360k (Brainlab Navigation) to $1.3mm (Stryker Mako) and carry average annual maintenance fees of $200k and an average cost per surgery of $950.  Furthermore, surgeons often have preferred placement algorithms to which they adhere for all patients. While these systems can accurately place an implant as the surgeon intends, that placement may not fit the specific patient’s activities of daily living or morphology.  Surgeons generally perceive all incumbent systems as challenging to use and disruptive to the surgical workflow. They increase procedure time and complexity and require the use of invasive bone pins to support optical trackers. A survey of CAIRA Surgeon Advisors summarized the disadvantages associated with the use of pins and optical trackers.   a. Pins are placed outside the surgical field, which requires separate incisions. b. In the case of TKA, existing systems require the use of four pins (two in the femur, two in the tibia), with some systems requiring three pins per bone. c. Pins carry inherent risk of pin-site pain, pin-site infection and pin-related fracture. d. Line-of-site disruption: Surgical personnel are constantly required to move around the surgical table to avoid obstructing the line-of-site between the system and the optical trackers. e. Pins and optical trackers obstruct freedom of movement for the surgeon and surgical team, who must avoid disrupting the position of the pins and trackers throughout the procedure.  Lastly, all incumbent robotic systems are usable only with the manufacturers implants (E.g., Stryker Mako, Smith & Nephew NAVIO).   Despite the benefits these systems can provide, their high cost and inherent clinical drawbacks have limited clinical adoption. For example, after more than 13 years of clinical use and an exponential expansion of sales and marketing capacity following its 2013 acquisition by Stryker, the Mako surgical robot, which is the market leader, is resident in only 18% of US hospitals (Piper Jaffrey).   The highest utilization of navigation worldwide is in Australia, where only 33.6% of all primary TKA’s utilized navigation in 2017 (AOANJRR 2018 Annual Report) after more than two decades of clinical availability in that market.","CAIRA is taking a different approach.  We are leveraging multiple proprietary technologies to develop inexpensive, minimally invasive surgical navigation that integrates seamlessly into the surgical workflow and is elegantly simple to use.   Our first product is a navigation system for total knee replacement (TKR), which is the largest joint replacement segment by procedure volume with the highest rate of patient dissatisfaction and greatest revision burden (AAOS AJRR 2019).   CAIRA Knee Assist™ helps surgeons reliably achieve patient specific implant placement that restores each patient’s biomechanics to their individual, pre-arthritis, pre-deformity state. This biomechanical restoration increases patient satisfaction and reduces the potential for subsequent complications resulting in revision surgery.  The system creates procedural efficiencies through reliable, fast anatomic registration utilizing a proprietary, intraoperative surface mapping technology that enables instant registration of anatomic landmarks required to navigate each case. The intraoperative surface mapping scan takes 45 seconds, and CAIRA software registers landmarks in less than one minute.   CAIRA Knee Assist eliminates optical trackers through the use of proprietary, radar-based tracking technology that features small, disposable Active Tracking Beacons™ that secure to the femur and tibia inside the surgical field via minimally invasive anchors, avoiding the need for additional incisions.   CAIRA Knee Assist is intended to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of navigated knee replacement procedures, while simultaneously decreasing cost, complexity and risk associated with incumbent surgical navigation and robotic systems.","Sensors, Robotics, Surgery, Orthopedics, Surgical Navigation","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/CAIRA_Surgical","No","No",""

Of the two, we feel that the first is an immensely more challenging existential problem, while the latter is a question of engineering that we specialize in. Thus, Centivax focuses on diseases for which the targets are known, but there is an engineering problem interfering with efforts thus far to drug them. We then use our unfair advantage, computational immunoengineering technologies, to solve the engineering problem and make practical and effective medicines. For antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, multi-drug resistant bacteria and snake venom, we engineer broadly neutralizing antibodies and often combine them as cocktails to inhibit multiple virulence factors and/or toxins simultaneously. We further apply considerate Fc engineering to extend half-life and manipulate host effector functions appropriate to the biology of the disease we are aiming to treat. For vaccines against rapidly mutating pathogens such as influenza, HIV, and the coronavirus, we have developed a broad-spectrum vaccine technology capable of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies.

This number is projected to rise to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045. Diabetic metabolic abnormalities including hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia lead to microvascular complications causing end organ damage. These include diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. Diabetic complications greatly diminish quality of life and decrease life expectancy of patients with diabetes. The socioeconomic burden of diabetic complications is very large, costing the health system at least USD 966 billion dollars in health expenditure.  Recent advances using pharmacotherapy greatly expand treatment options for diabetic complications, however currently available treatments are directed at the very late stage in the disease, when full reversal of microvascular damage is difficult. Thus, a conceptual and technical breakthrough to identify novel targets and a strategy to cure diabetic complications is paramount.","Ceramedix’s therapeutic strategy is designed to manipulate a structure, the ceramide-rich platform (CRP), discovered in the Kolesnick lab at MSKCC in 2001. CRPs are macrodomains (0.5-2.0 uM diameter) that form on the surface of endothelial cells in response to potentially-lethal stress and signal death by apoptosis. For endothelial cells, this is the exclusive mechanism for cell death induction as mice lacking acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), which upon activation generates ceramide within seconds to minutes, are entirely resistant to all therapeutically-relevant doses of ionizing radiation. This observation led to a series of studies that showed such mice are also resistant to the gastrointestinal-acute radiation syndrome (GI-ARS), a fatal outcome of a limited nuclear attack on an American urban center for which there is no therapy. As ASMase generates ceramide on the endothelial cell surface, it was reasoned that it might be amenable to an anti-ceramide antibody approach. Anti-ceramide Abs are in fact highly-effective in preventing CRP formation on irradiated endothelial cells, and consequently prevent and treat the GI-ARS. The Radiation Countermeasure Program at NIAID and the Department of Defense have invested >$12M in development of our anti-ceramide Abs, which have been shown to be highly-effective in NHPs to treat GI-ARS injury. 

Extension of these concepts to other well-established human pathophysiologies mediated by microvascular damage has demonstrated enormous promise. In this context, Ceramedix Inc. is focusing on anti-ceramide Abs as a mechanism-based treatment for diabetic retinopathy.  ASMase activation and CRP formation plays a critical role in diabetes-induced retinal endothelial cell damage leading to microvascular pathophysiology in diabetic retinopathy, as was first demonstrated by Busik lab at MSU. Importantly, retinal microvascular pathology can be completely inhibited by anti-ceramide Abs in pre-clinical models, consistent with prevention of disease onset and progression. Based on these exciting discoveries, Ceramedix, Inc. is developing first-in-class therapeutics to treat the microvascular damage caused by diabetic metabolic abnormalities that leads to end organ injury and the eventual failure of vital organs.  Lead Program involves development of an anti-ceramide Abs to be indicated for Diabetic retinopathy.","Diabetes, microvascular injury, Anti-ceramide antibodies, retinopathy, nephropathy","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Ceramedix,_Inc.","No","No",""

"Cohesys Inc.","JLABS @ Toronto (Toronto)","Current Resident","","","MedTech","Orthopaedics","Crani-Maxillofacial Devices",,,,,,"Company is developing a bone tape that can help with fixation of facial bones and obviate the need for mechanical fixation devices and associated issues.","Fractures to the cranium and face (craniomaxillofacial, CMF) are extremely common and generally occur after trauma such as car accidents or sporting injuries. Titanium screw and plate systems are the current gold standard for CMF fracture stabilization. Fractures to load bearing regions of bone, such as mandibular fractures, require strong, rigid fixation in order resist further damage from mastication or other loads which occur during normal activity. However, most CMF fractures occur in regions of the bone which do not undergo significant loading outside of traumatic injury. Metallic micro and mini-plate systems are thus over-engineered for such applications and present practical challenges due to complicated installation procedures requiring long operative times. Plates are physically adapted in situ to fit the contour of the bone, and screws must be carefully selected to reflect varying bone thickness and integrity, as well as the location of foramina (nerve pathways). Poor bone quality, such as in osteoporosis or in complex comminuted fractures present a particular challenges with respect to achieving sufficient screw purchase and fixation. The inherent complexity of existing systems increases surgical time and complication rates.   Plate and screw systems for CMF fixation often result in complications requiring removal or revision. Implant removal incidence has been reported to be as high as 50%. Complications include pain, irritation, temperature sensitization, loosening of screws, and implant exposure. Several case reports have also specified the tendency for these fixation systems to migrate trans-cranially, thus causing damage to nearby structures and soft tissue. This is especially true in pediatrics, due to the rapid growth and remodeling of young patients. To address this issue, a small percentage (~10-15%) of fixation systems are made with resorbable PLA/PLGA. However, these systems continue to employ the screw and plate model; thus, suffering from similar limitations. It is evident that a new fixation system for CMF fracture intervention is needed. The use of a bioresorbable, surgical tape could be indicated for CMF fractures to non-load bearing (or low load) bones, thereby reducing surgical times, and eliminating many complications which arise from microplate fixation.","BoneTape is a novel bone fracture fixation technology, for plastic and oral/maxillofacial surgeons, that provides an easy-to-use, flexible, low-profile, biocompatible, and bioresorbable system for the alignment and stabilization of non-loadbearing craniomaxillofacial (CMF) fractures. The patent-protected system consists of a thin degradable polymer sheet coated with a novel bioadhesive, designed to cure in physiological conditions. BoneTape is implanted onto bone during normal fracture reduction procedures, providing sufficient mechanical stability to aid in fracture healing and is designed to be resorbed after bone healing takes place. The main components of this system are derived from FDA approved biocompatible materials. The bioadhesive is inspired by adhesive proteins of marine organisms. This novel fracture fixation system provides a simple and effective approach for CMF fracture fixation. The design and application of BoneTape is uniquely suited to mid- and upper-facial fractures, and any non-load bearing regions of bone. This system is particularly well-suited to regions of minimal loading and especially those of poor bone quality. Additionally, surgical time is incredibly expensive, with operating rooms alone billing at approximately $85/minute. This does not include preparation costs or surgical and support staff. By reducing complication rates, which frequently require additional surgical procedures to correct, and procedural time, BoneTape presents a compelling case for both reducing overall costs and improving the outcome of CMF fixation.    BoneTape will be the first flexible adhesive-based fixation device for CMF fractures to market. The BoneTape adhesive has a number of benefits over traditional titanium plates and screws including fully resorbable, translucent, initial flexibility (cures upon exposure to body heat), and decreased fixation time and complexity.  Previous adhesive technologies, such as those used in dentistry, require multiple preparation steps, clean working environments, and in many cases, light curing as well. This is not practical for use in the confines of CMF surgery, especially considering surgical access for complicated procedures like orbital floor reconstruction. Our technology is disruptively transformative – existing devices employ exclusively screws, plates, meshes or rivets for fracture fixation. Cohesys’ adhesive technology allows for strong bonding to wet or dry bone in a single step, allowing surgeons the ability to address CMF fractures in a less destructive manner, regardless of bone quality.","Orthopedics, Bone Fixation, Surgery","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Cohesys_Inc.","Yes","No",""

developments in the search to restore immune response in autoimmune diseases and induce tolerance.
Antigen-specific immunotherapy is designed to reprogram or dampen the immune response to a
particular antigen or set of closely associated antigens. The main challenge in developing effective ASI is
to efficiently target and trigger dendritic cells (DCs) in order to elicit a specific, potent, and long-term
immune response without adverse effects. Only then these types of treatments can be successfully
applied in a clinical setting. DC4U tackles this challenge by developing a radically new and innovative
technology (the GlycoDC Platform™) that enables the development of highly effective ASI, based on
inducing immune tolerance to antigens for Celiac Disease and Type 1 Diabetes and potentially other
autoimmune disorders.","DC4U’s proprietary platform technology (the GlycoDC Platform™) enables the development of glycanantigen
conjugates that are used to instantly reprogram the immune system to induce durable immune
tolerance to a specific autoantigen. To induce tolerance, sialic acids (alpha 2,3-Sia), are used as glycans.
Glycans are naturally occurring carbohydrate structures that cover the surfaces of all human cells. These
glycans can serve as recognition elements for glycan sensor molecules that, upon recognition, mediate
cellular communication. We covalently bind Alpha2,3-Sia to an antigen of choice (peptide, protein or
lipid) by a process called glycation using a specific linker. The selection of the (auto)-antigen is crucial in
developing a cure for the disease of interest. In most cases the disease causing auto-antigens are
unknown. However, in diabetes and celiac disease the auto-antigens towards which the auto-immune is
targeted are well known. Specific peptides based on these autoantigens are then glycated to Sia. These
glycan-(auto)antigen conjugates, so called “ImmunoGlycs”, specifically target glycan binding receptors
on dendritic cells (DCs) called Siglecs. These constructs bind specifically to those Siglecs that will induce
a tolerogenic signal and thereby induce tolerance by instructing the DC that the antigen is “SELF”
(meaning originating from the body's own constituents) and “SAFE” (harmless protein that does not
provoke the immune system to react against it). Through this pathway, ImmunoGlycs instruct the
immune system of patients to induce tolerance to the antigens, leading to a lifelong cure.","glycans, immunology, autoimmune, antigen-specific immunotherapy, Type 1 Diabetes, Celiac Disease","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/DC4U_Technologies","No","No",""

Although checkpoint therapies are able to cure many previously incurable patients, only about 15% of patients receiving this type of therapy respond. The main limitation of existing therapies is that they each only activate one or a small number of key steps in either the innate or adaptive immune system, but there is general agreement that highly efficient cancer immunotherapy will require activation of both innate and adaptive immunity. Unfortunately, no one has been able to discover and develop a therapy that safely induces both innate and adaptive anti-tumor or anti-viral immune responses.","Our innate and adaptive immune systems are each capable of cell-mediated destruction of tumors if the tumor cells are recognized as foreign or damaged. Activation of innate and adaptive responses is also dependent on immune cells sensing the presence of “danger.” The most potent immune cell activating danger signals are released by bacteria and viruses in the setting of infection, and include agonists of immune cell receptors, such as Toll-Like (TLRs), NOD and STING. Bacterial danger signals, including TLR agonists, can activate both innate and adaptive immune cells, including antigen-presenting cells, promoting innate (NK,  macrophage) and adaptive (T cell-mediated) destruction of tumors.
Decoy Biosystems has developed patented treatment methods (and associated patented compositions) for attenuation and killing of non-pathogenic, Gram-negative bacteria. Decoy-treated bacteria induce significantly less systemic toxicity than untreated bacteria, but are still able to activate innate and adaptive immune responses. We have observed significant single agent anti-tumor activity and/or combination therapy-mediated eradication of established non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, as well as colorectal, hepatocellular and pancreatic carcinoma in pre-clinical syngeneic and human tumor xenograft models. Decoy bacteria safely synergize with each of at least five different classes of approved agents, including checkpoint therapy and targeted antibodies, to induce tumor eradication, providing significant flexibility for targeting of diverse types of cancer. Decoy technology eradicates tumors via activation of both innate (NK cell) and adaptive (CD4+ and CD8+ T cell) mechanisms, producing both innate and adaptive immunological memory. Tumor eradication occurs at non-toxic doses of Decoy bacteria, with a very wide (>33-fold) therapeutic index. Significant mechanism of action information has also been obtained demonstrating, for example, that Decoy technology turns “cold” tumors into “hot” tumors. We have also demonstrated significant single agent activity against HBV and HIV infection in standard pre-clinical models.

Additionally, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States, with 160340 deaths estimated in 2012 (ACS, 2012). Only 16.6% of lung cancer patients live five years or more after diagnosis (Siegel et al., 2014). The predominant risk factor for lung cancer is smoking, accounting for approximately 90% of these lung cancer deaths (ACS, 2018). Lung cancer risk is associated with several indicators of inflammation, including pulmonary fibrosis (Le et al., 2007), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Eide et al., 2016), and chronic pulmonary infections (Karampitsakos et al., 2017), even after considering the effects of smoking. In addition to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted molecular therapy, adjuvant therapies targeting the tumor microenvironment have received considerable attention in recent years (Wu et al., 2018, Dinarello 2018). The inflammatory milieu comprises infiltrated immune cells, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, which contribute to tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and chemoresistance (Crossman, 2018). In 2017, the CANTOS (Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study) trial results, based on a reduction in circulating CRP in inflammatory diseases upon treatment with Canakinumab (Ilaris®), were published (Ridker et al., 2017a). CANTOS tested the hypothesis that IL-1? inhibition would have beneficial effects on (1) a composite endpoint in patients with prior myocardial infarction, and (2) a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level that constituted a vascular risk (?2 mg/L) (Ridker et al., 2017a). Trial results showed dose-related reductions in the primary endpoint of the first occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death along with with the pre-specified, complex statistical threshold for primary and secondary endpoints being met with the 150-mg dose (Ridker et al., 2018).  A follow-up meta-analysis study reported the reduction of new cases of (incident) lung cancers in the group of patients who had received the largest two doses of Canakinumab (Ridker et al., 2017b). Canakinumab (300 mg) significantly reduced lung cancer mortality compared to placebo treatment. These data suggest that DNX-314 may act as an “Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor” of IL-1? in the early stages of lung cancer, leading to improved NSCLC patient outcomes.","The Company’s lead product, DNX?314, is a PASylated® IL?1 inhibitor that demonstrates significantly longer half?life’s (>90?fold) and enhanced efficacy versus Kineret® (rmethuIL?1Ra; Anakinra; Swedish Orphan Biovitrum) in nonclinical models.

Its goal is to develop a first- in-class, self-standing, automated, cancer diagnostic instrument that will empirically determine the optimal treatment for individual cancer patient.","The EMPIRI technology addresses several problems in the oncology space, from untreatable metastasis to inefficient drug development pipeline. 

1) Despite over 120 FDA approved anticancer treatments, standard of care (SoC) for any given tumor type utilizes only a handful of drugs in different combinations, mostly due to historical practices in FDA approval process for new therapies. In addition, the majority of patients with metastatic, high grade tumors are provided with only palliative care or enrolled in clinical trials for experimental treatments.  We propose that the current arsenal of anti-cancer agents are under-utilized by current clinical practices and EMPIRI will maximize the usage of currently approved drugs while optimizing benefit/toxicity ratio. 

2) While the need for personalized cancer care is widely accepted, currently used methods are suboptimal for multiple reasons.  
a) Routinely used histological analyses can only provide minimal molecular information of individual tumors, and the number of reliable biomarkers predictive of therapy response is very limited. 
b) DNA sequencing analyses can only make indirect inferences about putative driver or targetable mutations in each tumor; therefore, the majority of patients with targetable mutations do not respond to matching targeted therapies. 
c) Currently available cell-based assays destroy critical information in patient samples: cell:cell communication and interactions among different cell types that contribute to overall tissue response to therapy. 
d)  Patient derived xenografts are highly cost- and time- consuming and lack immune components.    

3) >90% of phase III trials fail after incurring significant costs.  More comprehensive and clinically-relevant patient tumor response measurements and assessment of mechanisms of action in earlier trial phases will significantly improve clinical trial design, patient selection, and biomarker analyses and ultimately success.

4) There is a great need for a more rigorous and cost-effective but physiologically-relevant preclinical platform that can quickly and efficiently assess the therapeutic potential of new drugs in the pipeline to guide drug development priorities in pharmaceutical companies.","EMPIRI has a novel solution for each of these problems.  EMPIRI is building an automated instrument, based on a proprietary method, that enables empirical determination of treatment responses to any anti-cancer therapeutic types, including immunotherapies.  EMPIRI addresses above problems by:
1) EMPIRI Cal (our instrument) can be used as a companion diagnostic, measuring effectiveness of each drug in a SoC for a given tumor type, providing data-driven selection of a treatment regime for each patient with an option of eliminating ineffective drugs for that patient (reducing toxicity and cost) 

2)  EMPIRI can identify potentially effective drugs for cancer patients with no treatment options, using a relatively small piece of tumor and screening a large panel of drugs, including all FDA approved drugs.

3) EMPIRI can super charge clinical trials by performing correlative studies, by providing early response data (4 days) and mechanistic insights from genomic, proteomic, and histological analyses of treated patient tissues.

4) EMPIRI culture media is chemically define, enabling facile biomarker discoveries

5) EMPIRI platform maintains tumor resident immune cells ex vivo and can be used to test immunotherapies, alone or in new combinations

The company is also developing its innate immune modulators as vaccine adjuvants. 
Based in Melbourne (Australia), the company has secured over AUD35 million Series A investment from Brandon Capital Partners’ managed funds, the Minderoo Foundation and Uniseed.","Respiratory viral infections are among the most common causes of morbidity worldwide. They can have severe health consequences for individuals at risk of exposure (e.g. essential services personnel, first responders and military personnel) and/or at risk of complications due to comorbid conditions, such as chronic respiratory, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, patients prescribed with high-dose corticosteroids, patients with lymphoma or chronic leukemia and immunocompromised patients. 
The elderly (>65 years old) and patients with chronic respiratory diseases such as COPD and asthma are particularly at risk. In the US, an estimated 56 million individuals are aged 65+, including 10.8m diagnosed with COPD or asthma. In 2019, complications of VRI led to over 1.8m Health Care Provider (HCP) visits and 150,000 hospitalizations among the elderly, mainly during the winter months. Due to the emergence of COVID, these doubled to 3m HCP visits and over 300,000 hospitalizations in 2021.
Influenza, RSV or COVID are not the only viruses resulting in complications. Acute exacerbations in COPD are mainly caused by rhinovirus, for which no approved vaccines or direct-acting antivirals exist. Human metapneumovirus outbreaks have also been linked to ER visits and hospitalization among seniors.","ENA Respiratory Pty Ltd (ENA) is developing INNA-051, a convenient self-administered, medical countermeasure designed to protect at-risk individuals against complications caused by viral respiratory infections (VRIs).
In a Phase IIa influenza-challenge study, INNA-051 was found to accelerate virus clearance and to boost host responses against influenza virus, including interferon responses.
Key features of INNA-051 intranasal administration include minimal systemic bioavailability, durable immune response (supporting weekly administration) and compatibility with available vaccines and corticosteroids. Importantly, INNA-051 activity is not significantly affected by senescence (inlammaging) and its safety profile supports prophylaxis use.
Being agnostic to specific viruses or viral variants, INNA-051 has the potential to be rapidly deployed and complement vaccine and direct-acting antiviral efforts in the battle against current and future respiratory virus outbreaks, including COVID-19.","Broad-Spectrum Antivirals, Innate Immunity, Respiratory","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/ENA_Respiratory_Pty_Ltd","No","Yes",""

Enhancers often don’t regulate proximal genes, but instead engage in physical contacts with target genes located hundreds of kilobases away on the linear genome map.

• The first attempts used specific antigens (unique molecules of the cancer cell or infectious agent) to induce an immune response. Many mediators for presenting the antigens are investigated: cancer cells, part of cells, DNA or proteins/peptides. To date, none of them yielded satisfactory results in the induction of an immune response that is sufficiently strong for resulting in a clinical response — not even when combined with adjuvants. Moreover, the safety aspects of some of these approaches (inclusion of genetic materials) remains an open question.

• The attention then shifted to using the patient's own dendritic cells as key mediator to trigger an effective immune response. Dendritic cells that were simply loaded ex vivo with tumor-associated antigens did effectively induce some immune response in patients, and even some clinical response - though unfortunately not sufficiently strong.","The mRNA constructs of the TriMix-based immunotherapy are coding for both the tumor-specific antigens as well as for three unique and crucial proteins that jointly stimulate the patient’s dendritic cells to produce a more potent and larger population of cytotoxic and helper T-cells.

Greater Houston, home to four Nobel Laureates and 120 members of the National Academies, has over a billion dollars of basic research along with a vibrant ecosystem of patient care, clinical research, and key opinion leaders. But product commercialization lags. The rate limiting resource is generally not funding.  Rather it is the lack of entrepreneurs with biomedical development experience, whether in pharmaceuticals, medical devices or diagnostics.  Fannin, the most active biomedical development group in Texas, was created to address this gap.   

 

Our experienced team is actively researching to identify innovative technology with critical unmet needs like such as aging-related diseases (e.g., osteoarthritis, arteriosclerosis, glaucoma) and conditions (e.g., skin wrinkling and deterioration) in addition to resistance to current cancer drugs.","Fannin’s approach to early-stage commercialization of academic research complements the more traditional academic paths of either out-licensing the technology to industry or spinning it out as a standalone VC-funded startup.  In our hybrid approach, Fannin serves as both the management team and the early investor, collaborating with the academic inventors to advance the technology, leveraging grant funding at early stages, and spinning it out when appropriate. Since inception, Fannin has brought in ~35 programs, of which ~15 are active, including three in the clinic.  We have had ~$140 million invested across our programs, ~$38 million from grant funding with the rest from investors.

More urgently speaking, the global mental health crisis was amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought along with-it long periods of social isolation and psychological distress.  There was a nearly 200% increase in mental health hospitalizations from 2020-2021.  Additionally, one out of three individuals mentioned the COVID-19 pandemic as a reason for presenting for mental health treatment.

While other medical practices have been using objective measurement tools for decades, when it comes to mental conditions, we still rely on self-reported questionnaires to make diagnosis or treatment decisions. Due to lack of objective measurement tools for mental health, support and care is fragmented and episodic, often limited to the point of care and therefore leading to delayed intervention.

To solve this global challenge, we need smart, digital, data-driven, and more precise mental health solutions like Feel Therapeutics which provide rich data to develop real-world evidence, explore novel digital biomarkers and endpoints in the field of neuroscience, and help us more objectively measure mental health for improved outcomes.

Mental health also presents itself as a comorbidity to most chronic conditions. In oncology, depression increases mortality rates by up to 39%, and only 51% (vs. 92%) of patients who suffer from depression commenced chemotherapy. Additionally, >70% of oncologists and 85% of patients believe that mood affects the progression of cancer.  Fatigue and mental health are also some of the core symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. One out of two MS patients experience depression and 1 out of 3 MS patients suffer from anxiety disorders. MS patients with current mood or anxiety disorders were almost 5x times as likely to exhibit adherence issues.  We additionally see mental health as a comorbidity in other chronic conditions such as Atopic Dermatitis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Diabetes.","Feel provides rich data to develop RWE, support reimbursement and clinical development, improve outcomes, and explore digital biomarkers and endpoints in psychiatry and neuroscience, and partners with CROs and pharma to bring digital health solutions and therapeutics to market as standalone programs or alongside medications.

Despite tremendous progress in the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune disease, interpatient and intrapatient heterogeneity greatly impact clinical outcomes of currently available and upcoming therapeutics. Identifying molecular markers that define inflammatory cell states as well as key pathogenic targets that would lead to broader indication remains a challenge. The complexity of such diseases and more specifically the multiplicity of the immune response requires novel screening solutions to identify key biomarkers that can be leveraged for both patient stratification and therapeutic development purposes. Single cell genomics has proven to be a powerful tool for the deciphering of heterogenous cell populations, including for immune system characterization but current solutions are often limited to “snapshot” genomic measurements leaving out key functional characterization and the ability to look at cell-to-cell interactions and live cellular responses. While recent methods such as droplet-based single cell genomics and spatial transcriptomics have provided key insights on immune cell population heterogeneity and tissue context information respectively, more traditional bulk fluorescent-activated cell sorting and plate-based gold-standard immunoassays are still essential to validate and further explore hypothesis inferred by sequencing readouts. However, the multiplicity of tools and technologies and their deployment constitute a challenge especially for the collection and analysis of precious and scarce clinical samples.","Flexomics was founded with the vision to accelerate the translation of single cell genomic insights into clinical applications by putting functional relevance at the heart of its approach. More specifically, our core technology emerged from the unmet need for high-throughput single cell approaches bridging functional and genomic analysis which is especially relevant for the molecular stratification of complex diseases, the identification of pathogenic causes and the characterization of therapeutic responses.   To address these challenges, Flexomics is developing the next generation of screening solution that incorporates cell imaging and genomics readouts into a single platform. Our technology is especially well-suited for the functional characterization of complex immune samples, including the identification of antigen-specific T-Cell Receptors (TCRs) and Immunoglobulins (Ig).  Our proposed technology combines gold-standard immunoassays with state-of-the-art single cell genomic approaches in a single platform to directly test and connect key cellular functions and states to broader genome-wide analysis for complex cell populations at single cell level. Our approach has the potential to further dissect the functional and pathogenic relevance of each individual cell in a complex population by pairing key live cell readout such as inflammatory cytokines secretion while also retrieving clinically relevant information such as specific gene pathway regulation or T-cell receptors and Immunoglobulin sequences from stimulated lymphocytes. Thanks to its unique ability to screen for pathogenic and functionally relevant target cells in a high-throughput manner, Flexomics’ platform has the potential to redefine our understanding of the immune-mediated disease state to support patient stratification and personalized treatment development.","Single cell genomics, platform, auto-immune disease, immuno-oncology","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Flexomics_LLC","Yes","No",""

Current modalities for evaluating GI disease typically rely on colonoscopies, which are invasive, expensive, and time-consuming. Within the oncology space, over 40% of Americans are not up-to-date with recommended colorectal cancer screening guidelines due to direct aversion to colonoscopies. Within the auto-immune space (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), individuals are often subjected to several non-specific tests in addition to colonoscopies for initial diagnosis and must use a trial-and-error strategy for employing effective treatment. Additionally, lack of access to adequate medical care, especially for individuals that face health disparities, impedes the ability to reduce the GI disease burden.  Geneoscopy's goal is to make reliable, accurate, noninvasive screening for GI diseases a routine standard of care.","Geneoscopy has developed a novel method to reliably extract and quantify eukaryotic RNA biomarkers in stool samples (seRNA).

Metabolic diseases, encompassing conditions like diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and lipid disorders, stem from impairments in the body's capacity to metabolize food into energy, maintain physiological processes, and clear waste.

Key ways nutrition influences these metabolic diseases include:
1.	Stunt Development: Poor dietary choices, such as consuming excessive amounts of sugar, unhealthy fats, and processed foods contribute to the development of metabolic diseases. These unhealthy dietary patterns lead to insulin resistance, high blood sugar levels, high cholesterol, and obesity, which are all risk factors for metabolic disorders.
2.	Poor Management: The lack of proper nutrition enhances symptoms of metabolic diseases. For example, individuals with diabetes are often advised to follow a balanced diet that is low in simple sugars and high in complex carbohydrates, fiber, and healthy fats, but for many, a food inequity exists. This depletes stable blood sugar levels and increases the risk of complications. Similarly, those with lipid disorders need to consume a diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol to manage their condition, but most experience food inequity.
3.	Lack of Prevention: There is little adoption of a healthy and balanced diet which can significantly reduce the risk of developing metabolic diseases. Given the vast food inequity, many cannot consume a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats, along with regular physical activity, to help maintain a healthy weight, improve insulin sensitivity, and support overall metabolic health.
4.	Negative Interaction with genetic factors: Proper nutrition can interact with genetic factors to influence the risk of developing metabolic diseases. Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to metabolic disorders but may not develop the disease if they maintain a healthy lifestyle and diet. Poor nutrition can exacerbate genetic risk factors and increase the likelihood of developing a metabolic disease.","A digital app combined with a team of nutritionists and a food delivery service can be highly beneficial for individuals with metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. The integrated approach offers several advantages:
1.	Personalized nutrition guidance: A team of nutritionists can provide tailored dietary recommendations based on an individual's specific metabolic disease, lifestyle, and preferences. The digital app can facilitate easy communication between patients and nutritionists, allowing for real-time adjustments to dietary plans as needed.
2.	Convenient meal options: The food delivery service can provide pre-prepared, nutritionally balanced meals that adhere to the dietary guidelines provided by the nutritionists. This convenience can help patients maintain a healthy diet, even when they lack the time, knowledge, or motivation to prepare their own meals.
3.	Improved disease management: Proper nutrition is crucial for managing metabolic diseases, as it can help regulate blood sugar levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and support weight management. By offering personalized nutrition guidance and convenient meal options, the integrated approach can help patients more effectively manage their metabolic conditions and reduce the risk of complications.
4.	Increased adherence to treatment plans: Patients with metabolic diseases often require lifestyle modifications and dietary changes to complement their medical treatments. The digital app, nutritionists, and food delivery service can work together to support patients in adhering to their treatment plans, leading to better outcomes and overall health.
5.	Enhanced patient education and empowerment: The digital app can offer educational resources and tools to help patients understand their metabolic disease, track their progress, and make informed choices about their nutrition. This increased knowledge can empower patients to take control of their health and make lasting lifestyle changes.
6.	Support for behavior change: The digital app can provide features like reminders, goal-setting tools, and progress tracking to help patients stay accountable and motivated as they work towards healthier habits. Nutritionists can also offer personalized guidance and encouragement to help patients overcome challenges and maintain their new dietary habits.
7.	Better health outcomes: By promoting adherence to dietary guidelines, the digital app, nutritionists, and food delivery service can contribute to improved health outcomes for individuals with metabolic diseases. This can result in better blood sugar control, weight management, and reduced risk of complications such as cardiovascular diseases, kidney diseases, and neuropathy.
8.	Data-driven insights: The digital app can collect data on patients' dietary habits, progress, and health outcomes, which can help healthcare providers and researchers better understand the relationship between nutrition and metabolic diseases. This data can inform future treatment plans and strategies for managing these conditions more effectively.

Initial targets included sleep, mood, and intestinal motility disorders.","Up to 30% of the global population suffers from sleep issues, and this comes with a substantially increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease, as well as behavioral disorders. Depression, recently classified as the leading cause of disability worldwide by the World Health Organization, affects up to 9% of adults in the U.S. per year, and an estimated 20% of the population will experience a depressive episode in their lifespan.  IBS is characterized by chronic abdominal pain and discomfort, and is estimated to effect between 10 and 20% of the U.S. population.   Unfortunately, a major problem with treating these disorders is the lack of efficacy of front line drugs, or lack of therapeutic options. For example, 29-46% of patients with depression do not see resolution or improvement of symptoms after front-line treatment, which are typically serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Nonetheless, in the past fifteen years only a handful of antidepressants have been brought to market, largely due to high clinical failure rates.  For IBS, very few drugs have been approved for its treatment, with one example being the 5-HT4 agonist tegaserod (Zelnorm), which was developed by Novartis. However, it was withdrawn due to an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. For sleep disorders, while several drugs exist today -- such as eszopiclone (Lunesta) or zolpidem (Ambien) -- many come with a high risk of addiction and a negative stigma. This is a likely reason why many individuals suffering from sleep disorders do not seek treatment (<20%).  Due to limited or poor therapeutic options for sleep disorders, treatment resistant depression, and IBS, these diseases impose an enormous socioeconomic burden on society and the affected individual, with an estimated annual global cost of over one trillion dollars. We seek to fix this, providing health solutions to those in need.","The lead products of Holobiome consist of bacteria able to alter host GABAergic and Serotonergic neurotransmission. Incredibly, intervention with these neurotransmitter modulating bacteria has been shown to provide antidepressant, anxiolytics, and improved intestinal motility phenotypes, multiple animal models, and microbiome intervention in humans can alter levels of these important nearutransmitters or their prescursons.  Providing these bacteria to patients will provide therapeutic efficacy in our target indications via stimulation of the enteric and peripheral nervous system locally and/or to the central nervous system via the vagus nerve. This approach -- manipulating host neurotransmission through the microbiome -- is a novel treatment modality.  A key feature of our products are there strong safety profiles. Many existing drugs for our target indications have considerable side effects, such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and addiction. Microbiome-based therapeutics, consisting of naturally occurring microbes that exist in healthy humans, are expected to be exceptionally safe with minimal side effects. This inherent safety will minimize regulatory costs and hurdles, while expediting the developmental timeline compared to traditional drugs. For the probiotic path, the fact these strains have evolved with and exist in humans reinforces their safety profiles, and has been received well by the FDA for generally regarded as safe (GRAS) notification submissions. Furthermore, unlike most existing microbiome therapeutics, the mechanism of action of our product is established and validated -- neurotransmitter modulation -- which has been well-received by Pharma partners. This, along with the potential to complement efficacy existing drugs, positions us well for market penetration.","Microbiome","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Holobiome_Corporation","No","No",""

Additionally, prevalence is on the rise, further contributing to the supply/demand gap. 1 in 5 children suffer from a diagnosable mental, behavioral and/or emotional condition, however in many cases 80% of children aren’t getting the treatment and support that they need, with the average length of time transpiring between presentation of symptoms to receiving care currently averaging 11 years.  
In 2013, the CDC reported that $247B was spent on pediatric mental health, and this number is only taking into account the children who have been diagnosed and are receiving some form of treatment. For treatment for these conditions to be effective, a lot of work needs to be done outside of a clinician’s office in the form of various exercises and interventions. Unfortunately, many children are disengaged in their treatment, which results in little to no progress, or even regression, between clinical sessions. Therefore, an immense amount of money is being wasted on clinical sessions and other treatments because children and parents do not complete the assigned protocols outside of the clinician’s office. Additionally, by not properly identifying at-risk children, our system is only reactively treating those once a diagnosis has been made, rather than proactively intervening to prevent, and/or mitigate, these conditions,

Stones form when bile, a compound made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, becomes supersaturated.  While gallstones do not cause a problem for most people, they occasionally block the cystic duct, preventing the gallbladder from emptying. This obstruction can result in pain and infection, which, in otherwise healthy patients is treated by surgical removal of the gallbladder.  The procedure is safe in otherwise healthy patients, and often does not require hospital admission.  In uncomplicated cases, patients are often back to work within two weeks.    However, there are a number of patient populations in whom the surgical risk associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considerably higher.  These populations include critically ill patients, patients with intra-abdominal scarring from chronic disease and previous surgery, and elderly patients who tend to have a higher incidence of medical comorbidities. The largest and best studied of these populations is the medicare population, which comprises approximately 200,000 laparoscopic cholecystectomies per year in the US and is expected to double by 2050.  Studies show that the medicare population experiences a perioperative complication rate of approximately 25% when undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, resulting in a $500M impact to the US healthcare system every year.   While non-operative management of these patients is a possibility, there is significant risk of disease recurrence with substantial associated costs. In an effort to curtail associated costs, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, recently announced that it plans to classify cholecystectomy as a bundled procedure.  Ultimately, this means that reimbursement for the management of complications from cholecystectomy will be significantly reduced, emphasizing the importance of primary prevention of these complications.  These findings underscore the need to develop a definitive, accessible, and low-risk treatment for gallstone disease.","Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the gold standard for the definitive treatment of gallstone disease. However, surgery is costly (on average $10,000 per procedure) and incurs considerable risk in certain populations.    Non-surgical treatment options include the administration of antibiotics and/or placement of a cholecystostomy tube to drain gallbladder contents.  While these treatment options avoid anesthesia, they do not treat the underlying cause of the disease. This leads to disease recurrence in over 20% of patients with associated hospitalization costs in excess of $7,000 per occurrence.   At Ictero Medical, we are developing the CholeSafe System, a novel, catheter-based platform that provides definitive treatment for gallstone disease. The device easily integrates into the current workflow in the interventional radiology suite, allowing physicians to offer their patients the benefits of surgery without the risk.  The CholeSafe system is a catheter-based, cryoablation system that can be percutaneously inserted into the gallbladder lumen and consists of two main components: a handheld catheter-based device to navigate and deliver therapy, and a control unit to precisely regulate power requirements. The device defunctionalizes the gallbladder via two mechanisms of action. First, it permanently occludes the cystic duct, preventing the re-accumulation of bile in the gallbladder and the future formation of gallstones. Next, the CholeSafe system denudes the gallbladder mucosa, preventing mucocele formation which can lead to organ distension, pain, and infection.   Unlike laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the CholeSafe system can be used in the IR suite and only requires local anesthesia (eliminating the risks associated with general anesthesia in high risk surgical patients).  Placement of the device leverages existing IR workflows and is deployed in a manner very similar to a cholecystostomy tube.","Cryoablation, Minimally Invasive Surgery, Interventional Radiology","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Ictero_Medical","No","No",""

(EMC) therapy, in which mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are induced to be immunosuppressive before being given to patients. Initially for treatment during bone marrow transplant.","Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) has the ability to cure patients of numerous malignant and inherited disorders; however, it is used conservatively due to the high risk of a patient developing graft-vs-host-disease (GvHD), in which donor T-cells that are “passengers” within the BMT assault the patient. GvHD can have an incidence anywhere from 30-70% and is a major contributor to transplant-related morbidity and mortality (30-40%). While long-term treatment and prophylaxis with immunosuppressive drugs can help, they have limited efficacy and come with undesirable side effects and a high infection risk. Thus, there is an unmet need to better prevent and treat GvHD, so that allo-BMT can be used to safely cure more patients.  We believe GvHD is an ideal beachhead market because:   1)	The science of our EMC therapy is well suited to improving the ability of MSCs to treat GvHD (based on literature and our own studies)  2)	We spoke with many physicians involved with previous MSC clinical trials for GvHD, and they agree that the current options under development have potential but are “not a home run” and that better science is required. As evidence of their support for Immplacate’s approach, we recruited several physicians who were/are lead investigators for the Prochymal trials to our scientific advisory board (e.g. Andrew Daly, Chris Dvorak)  3)	There is a high clinical unmet need and much room for market expansion  4)	Private DRG payments for allo-BMT are valued around 400-800K, while the procedure itself costs <150K. This leaves funds for treating complications like GvHD, which could cover the cost of our cell therapy. Thus, it can be covered by insurance under the allo-BMT DRG code even before it has its own MSC/EMC specific reimbursement code  5)	The orphan status of GvHD could accelerate our EMC therapy’s path through the FDA  While GvHD is a great starting place, we are excited by the prospect of our EMC therapy to provide a safe and effective treatment for diverse immune disorders, which is our overall mission statement as listed above.","Over the last 15 years, there have been hundreds of clinical trials testing MSCs for various conditions. While the safety is established, MSCs have been unpredictably effective and of lower potency than suggested by preclinical animal studies (e.g. refer to Osiris’ clinical trials of Prochymal from 2004-2009).  One reason for this is that all trials to-date have used “naïve” MSCs.  Our own studies and extensive literature research has demonstrated that MSCs are not immunosuppressive at baseline and must be “educated” towards this phenotype. While injecting naïve cells may lead to some cells eventually adopting the desirable behavior, this happens after a 1-2 day delay, and MSCs are thought to have a short life-span in vivo (< 1-week; consider how Prochymal was dosed 2x/week for 4 weeks). Thus, <100% of cells are therapeutic for <100% of the time.  Our approach at Immplacate is to have an “educated mesenchymal cell” (EMC) therapy where 100% of our cells are therapeutic from the moment they are injected.  To our knowledge, we are the first MSC company to take this approach, despite extensive literature support.  Beyond our EMCs having higher efficacy, there are additional advantages to such an approach. Leaders of the FDA’s MSC Consortium have critiqued how MSCs are usually defined by surface markers that are completely unrelated to their therapeutic capacity. By contrast, when Immplacate educates its MSCs, functional markers are predictably expressed that can be used for QC testing. We believe this will be viewed favorably by the FDA in terms of have a more standardized and predictable product.","Cell Therapy, Immune Disorder","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Immplacate","No","No",""

Local tumor ablation (e.g. RFA, microwave, laser, etc) and ablative radiation therapy (e.g. SBRT) is an effective local treatment strategy that is gaining significant traction in the clinic globally. However, while ablation is known to be clinically effective as a local treatment, the recurrence rate is often high, presumably due to existing micrometastatic lesions. Despite the presumed liberation of tumor antigens following ablation, and the formation of danger signals such as heat-shock proteins, it is only very rarely that ablations actually lead to reduction or elimination of tumors located outside the ablation area (referred to as an ""abscopal"" effect). It is hypothesized that the lack of a systemic anti-tumor immune response following ablation is due to the dispersion of the liberated antigens away from the site of ablation prior to a significant infiltration of antigen-presenting cells (APC), as well as insufficient uptake of high-quality antigens by the incoming APC.","Immunophotonics is developing IP-001, a novel drug product that transforms a local tumor ablation into a systemic immunotherapy.

Human induced-pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cell (hiPS-NPC) therapies have emerged as a promising regenerative strategy, however, key microenvironmental barriers limit their efficacy. First, the regional identity of conventionally derived NPCs does not match the recipient host identity creating a barrier for integration. Second, significant scar tissue limits neuron outgrowth and cell migration. Finally, graft survival has typically been low due to a paucity of trophic support in the injury environment. To address these key barriers and develop the first effective therapy for SCI, we have bioengineered hiPS-NPCs into Spinal Microenvironment Modifying and Regenerative Therapeutic (SMaRT) cells that possess three key features. 1) SMaRT cells express a cervical spinal cord specific regional identity to match recipient host tissues and facilitate improved graft-host integration; 2) SMaRT cells inducibly secrete a potent scar degrading enzyme; and 3) SMaRT cells express glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to enhance transplanted and endogenous cell survival and drive differentiation along a neuronal lineage. Additionally, SMaRT cells are designed to treat chronic SCI and thus open the market to the 1.2 million individuals currently living with a SCI in N.America. SMaRT cells represent the only stem cell therapy specifically designed for SCI and the only therapy with the potential to treat chronic SCI.","Neurodegeneration, Regenerative medicine, Spinal cord injury","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Inteligex","No","No",""

As a result 39% of breast cancers are discovered after spreading beyond local tissue, which highlights the pressing need for more accessible detection of cancers at earlier stages, when treatment is most effective and costs 10x less compared to late stage. Ultrasound is a scalable and highly sensitive technology proven to identify tumors at earlier stages.

"Iterion Therapeutics Inc. (fka. Beta Cat Pharmaceuticals LLC)","JLABS @ TMC (Houston)","Alumni","","","Pharmaceuticals","Oncology","Hematologic Malignancies",,,,,,"Beta Cat is developing small molecules that interrupt key tumor activator (cancer stem cell) pathways very close to transcription and at the bottom of the pathway. The lead compound is BC2059 which preferentially binds to transducin beta like protein 1 (TBL1), kicking off beta catenin. TBL1 is the protein which by binding to beta catenin, stabilizes it and escorts it into the nucleus where it drives oncogenic transcription. Free beta catenin is pushed out of the nucleus and destroyed by the Axin/APC/GSK beta catenin destruction complex. Beta Cat represents a unique potent and specific drugging of the pathway much closer and more effective than drugging at the FRZd receptor or soaking up the Wnt ligand, competitive approaches, and without damage to membrane bound beta catenin (important for bone) and normal stem cell pathways like those that repopulate the GI tract.","The Wnt pathway plays a critical role in early development through regulating the propagation and maintenance of stem cells. Therefore, the pathway is active during growth and development but mostly inactive in adults. Dysregulation of the pathway is a hallmark of many diseases where uncontrolled cell growth or function is a key pathology, such as cancer and fibrotic disease. One of the final steps in the Wnt pathway involves binding of two proteins, beta catenin and transducin beta-like protein 1 (TBL1), that once complexed enter the nucleus and turn on Wnt gene expression. Several cancers have been shown to be associated with mutations in the beta catenin gene itself or for one of the proteins involved in its degradation, making it an attractive therapeutic target.","Tegavivint has been shown to specifically inhibit the interaction between beta catenin
and TBL1, resulting in beta catenin degradation, and silencing of Wnt gene expression. Preclinical
studies suggest Tegavivint will be well tolerated with therapeutic potential across a broad range of
cancers. Earlier this year, the FDA allowed our Investigational New Drug (IND) application to initiate a Phase 1 clinical study in patients with desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis). Desmoid tumor cells grow slowly, but uncontrollably, due to abnormally high levels of beta catenin. Although the tumors do not metastasize, they can be disfiguring, extremely painful and sometimes lethal. By specifically targeting beta catenin, the hope is that Tegavivint will stop tumor growth and perhaps even result in their shrinkage. As this Phase 1 trial represents the first time the drug will be tested in people, the primary purpose is to define safety and determine the proper dose; however, patients will be closely and frequently monitored to assess bioactivity of the drug and potential tumor responses. In addition to our work with desmoids, the team has generated promising animal data demonstrating
therapeutic potential for Tegavivint in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), osteosarcoma, lymphoma, colon
and breast cancers, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). As we generate safety and dosing data from
the Phase 1 study, it will permit us to advance select additional indications toward the clinic.","Small Molecule Therapeutic","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Iterion_Therapeutics_Inc._%28fka._Beta_Cat_Pharmaceuticals_LLC%29","No","No",""

Program 2: identified ten host  gene antiviral effectors, which when delivered ectopically completely reconstitute the antiviral protection noted in ISG15 deficiency (so far tested against SARS-Cov2, HSV-1, ZIKA, IAV, and VSV). As such, delivery of modified RNAs encoding these factors via inhalation is a plausible therapeutic strategy against these viruses.

Project ASCENT will develop and implement a culturally sensitive, geographically tailored, and patient centric LCS education program, coupled with comprehensive patient navigation to increase uptake and adherence to LCS in the Latinx community in MCI’s catchment area.","Lung cancer remains the largest cause of cancer-related mortality in the Hispanic/Latinx community. This is largely due to the high proportion of late-stage cancer diagnosis in this population, as only 17% are diagnosed with localized disease. Primary risk reduction through access to smoking cessation is critical to improving outcomes. Ironically, most community members report a lack of access to smoking cessation programs that are tailored to the Hispanic/Latinx community. Use of cigars, cigarillos, and pipes is another common factor and the Hispanic/Latinx community has higher than the average social usage of these products compared to the US average. Another factor often associated is a sort of “positive optimism,” which causes Latinx women to be less likely to seek help and get themselves tested or screened early. In the views of Perez-Stable et al., who suggest that Latinos consider cancer a death sentence by God and/or a form of God’s punishment, there is also a socio-cultural and religious sentiment when it comes to early LCS hesitation in the Hispanic/Latinx population.      There are known barriers to LCS access and adherence in Hispanic/Latinx populations and there is significant need for community and HCP education and outreach to increase uptake of and compliance with LCS. The Patient Navigation Program at MCI provides the ideal resources and context (population served, resources, and community-based programs) to initiate innovative solutions to overcome this disparity.","Project Hypothesis: Development and implementation of a culturally sensitive, geographically tailored, and patient centric LCS education program, coupled with comprehensive patient navigation will increase uptake and adherence to LCS in the Hispanic/Latinx community in the catchment area of MCI   Aim 1: To improve patient access and activation in LCS through an enhanced culturally sensitive Patient Navigation program with the goal of bolstering lung cancer awareness, increasing utilization of preventative services, and increasing utilization of LCS   Aim 2: To utilize a patient navigation program to improve care coordination and patient navigation in the LCS    Aim 3: To understand the impact of social determinants of health and psychological distress on barriers to lung cancer uptake and adherence      To address the issue of low uptake and adherence to LCS, we propose an intervention study that would add a new component to the role of the patient navigator, namely training them specifically in a culturally sensitive and geographically tailored lung cancer screening navigation program. This initiative has the potential to contribute to the physical, emotional, and social well-being of individuals at elevated risk for lung cancer through a community-based, cost-effective, and empowering patient navigation model. Further, utilizing community engagement methods, we will be able to ensure the intervention meets the need through community input.

failed:
-Black women are 50% more likely to have their babies prematurely, which often comes with
lifelong health consequences for their children.
-Black women are 3-4x more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications and the disparity
gets wider among older mothers.
-Black women are more likely to experience severe maternal morbidity.
These disparities hold, even when adjusting for income and education.
In Washington, D.C., specifically:
-The D.C. maternal mortality rate is 35.6 per 100k live births versus the national rate of 29.6. For
Black women in D.C., the rate is significantly higher: 71 per 100k live births.
-Access to care facilities is lacking in city quadrants with significant Black populations, including
Wards 7 and 8. This is a stark contrast with Ward 2 which is predominantly composed of white
residents and has three times as many prenatal care facilities as Wards 7 and 8 combined.
-Half of Black women in D.C. do not get prenatal care until their second or third trimester.
-Black women suffered nearly 75% of all pregnancy-related deaths in D.C. from 2014 to 2016.
Poor maternal health outcomes take an enormous physical and emotional toll on women and their
families. They also add billions in costs to the U.S. healthcare system each year: Care for
mothers with preeclampsia alone costs over $1 billion annually, and premature births cost the
U.S. $26B annually (most recent estimate from 2005). While we know that continuous pregnancy
support, symptom screening, and timely interventions can prevent complications and reduce the
estimated 60% of maternal deaths deemed to be avoidable, far too many Black women do not
access this standard of care. One-third of Black pregnant women in the U.S. do not receive any
prenatal care in the first trimester, and one in ten only receive late (7.0%) or no prenatal care at
all (3.0%). Through our continuous care support model and marketplace of peer doulas and

remote maternal mental health screening and referral delivery, along with brief care coordination
for at-risk patients..","Perinatal deaths from suicide and overdose are often forgotten in discussions of maternal
mortality, even though various studies have found that when taken together, they are the leading
cause of pregnancy-related death (Davis et al., 2019; Rodriguez-Cabezas et al., 2019; Goldman-
Mellor et al., 2019). Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs), including depression, bipolar
disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder, are the most common complication of pregnancy and
childbirth, affecting up to 20% of new mothers. Moreover, these illnesses disproportionately
impact low-income mothers, single parents, and women of color (Yonkers et al., 2001; Zayas et
al., 2002; Bennett, 2004). Estimates of substance use disorders during pregnancy vary depending
upon the trimester of pregnancy and the age of the mother; approximately 10% of infants are
believed to be adversely affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol or drugs (Young, et al, 2009).
The risk for death by suicide or overdose peaks at six to nine months postpartum (David,
Smoots, et al., 2019; Rodriguez-Cabezas & Clark, 2018), a time when many women find
themselves in a sort of healthcare ""limbo"", with no one provider responsible for their care.
Studies have shown that up to 75% of women suffering from PMADs never receive treatment
(Byatt, Levin, Ziedonis, Moore-Simas, 2015). In 2017, 9,560 live births were recorded in the
District of Columbia: 48% Black, 32% White, 14% Hispanic, with the remainder a combination of
self-identified single race or multiracial origin (CDC, 2018). Given the estimated higher percentage
of women of color who experience PMADs, we conservatively estimate that over 2,000 individual
women suffer from a perinatal mental health complication each year, with 1,500 of them never
receiving the care they need and that they and their families deserve (Bravo, Perritt, 2020).
The impact of untreated PMADs is significant. The risk for preterm delivery is increased, and
women who are antenatally depressed are less likely to participate in recommended prenatal care
practices and are at increased risk of engaging in risky health behaviors, such as smoking and
substance use in pregnancy (Smith MV et al., 2011; Andersson et al., 2004).
Without treatment, PMADs can interfere with a parent’s ability to connect with and care for their
baby in the postpartum period as well. Research demonstrates that infants of parents with
untreated mental health disorders display less self-quieting/self-regulating ability (Field, 2010).
PMADs also appear to have a deleterious effect on infant attachment (Kuehn, 2010; Comasco et
al., 2011; Weisman et al., 2010), breastfeeding and care behaviors like reading and singing to
infants, attendance at well-child visits, and use of safety practices (Field, 2010). Untreated
PMADs have also been linked to cognitive and behavioral problems in older children (Posmontier &
Waite, 2011), and impaired brain development, executive functioning, and ability to self-regulate
(Dawson, Frey, et al.,1999).
Fortunately, with detection and treatment, mothers do get better and children show
improvements in their development, behavior, and overall mental health (Wickramaratne,
Gameroff, Pilowsky, 2011).
Health care professionals have long acknowledged that all women should be screened for PMADs
and other risk factors (Olin SC et al., 2016; Olson AL et al., 2006). Unfortunately, however, the
barriers to doing so remain high and an abysmally low percentage of women is actually screened
and identified in most healthcare contexts. In a Needs Assessment conducted by our Chief
Mental Health Officer in 2015 for Children's National Medical Center, two of the main barriers cited
by respondents were lack of knowledge about and lack of adequate time to provide appropriate
referrals where needed. In other words, doctors said they didn't want to ask the question
because they did not have the time or wherewithal to respond to the answer.
It is therefore abundantly clear that there is an urgent need for an accessible, low-cost, and
reliable screening system, as well as a streamlined process for connecting women with
appropriate, timely, and effective treatment. Moreover, because we know that even screening
plus referral doesn't always get moms connected to the help that they need, care coordination is
an essential part of any complete maternal mental health solution.
Fortunately, after years of advocacy, program development, and workforce development, the
time is ripe to address the maternal mental health crisis in Washington, DC. In just the past
decade, the first community-based Maternal Mental Health Program was founded at a Federally
Qualified Health Center in the District, a consortium of perinatal mental health providers was
formed, and a comprehensive PMH resource guide was established and is regularly updated. DC's
current Mayor, Muriel Bowser, began holding Maternal Child Health Summits in 2019 and has
continued to support efforts to improve maternal mental health care in the District throughout
her tenure. All of that effort led to the establishment in mid-2020 of the multi-million dollar Clark
Mother Child Health Initiative which, among other goals, aims to achieve universal maternal mental
health screening and risk assessment within the next five years.
Mammha wants to help DC's perinatal healthcare community achieve that goal.
Mammha is a mobile and web-based software platform that provides seamless, streamlined, inoffice
and remote maternal mental health screening and referral delivery, along with brief care
coordination for at-risk patients. The software is HIPAA compliant and available in English and
Spanish, with the ability to easily and quickly add new languages as needed. Mammha’s screening
includes smart notification, meaning a provider is notified immediately so they can review the
results before attending to their patient. Results are enhanced by talking points, optional scripts
if they can’t find the right words to use with their patient, and triage numbers in case they need
immediate consultation.
Providers can initiate screens either in their office or remotely through a screening link or QR
code. Patients can screen on their phone, a laptop, or tablet in the office. If a patient screens
positive, care is instantaneous via immediate connection to a Mammha Care Coordinator, who is a
trained peer-support specialist. Care coordinators connect patients with appropriate resources,
facilitate their access to care, and provide supportive counseling and check-ins until they feel
better. Mammha Care Coordinators are able to help expedite connections between patients and
potential clinicians, as Care Coordinators utilize a large internal network of mental health
professionals around the globe to help match women with appropriate care.
Current screening protocols typically involve no intervention at all for patients who screen
negative, despite the fact that most women who screen do so during pregnancy or at their sixweek
postpartum visit, while the peak of PMAD onset is between 3-4 months (Grigoriadis S,
Wilton AS, et al., 2017). Mammha solves that problem by providing the patient with an ongoing
connection to information, resources, and support if and when she needs it in the future. For
patients who screen positive, they are usually given a list of resources on a piece of paper that
has been photocopied hundreds of times and which is almost certainly outdated. Many moms
have told us that the mental health providers listed are often retired, no longer participate with
their insurance, are overbooked, or, perhaps worst of all, simply never call back.
Mammha’s target market is any professional who works in a healthcare capacity with perinatal
people. Such professionals include but are not limited to obstetricians, pediatricians,
neonatologists, midwives, and nurse practitioners. Enterprise-level deployment of Mammha would
be appropriate within birth and NICU hospitals and health systems, community health centers,
private practices, public health departments, and managed-care organizations, among others. The
market size for Mammha in the District is around 400 providers and several hospitals.
Mammha has several indirect competitors, namely Babyscripts and Chadis. We have been told by
our users that BabyScripts and Chadis lack the wraparound care coordination and niche expertise
that Mammha provides. Many practices and health systems administer their mental health screens
and risk assessments on paper, and then staff transfer the responses to the electronic health
record (EHR). Notably, this method of screening offers no support or scripting to the provider,
takes significantly more staff time, allows too much room for human error in the form of
misentered data, lost screens, etc. Patients may also be more likely to answer questions
truthfully if they can do so in the privacy of their device rather than responding to a provider or
having their results scored in front of them.","Maternal mortality, addressing key causes of maternal mortality during and after pregnancy","Maternal Health, Women's Health","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Mammha_LLC","Yes","No",""

Several sources of disparity have been identified including socioeconomic factors, inadequate access to care, cultural barriers (primarily historical distrust of the American healthcare system) and potential genetic factors. Another critical disparity suffered by the African American community is limited access to and participation in clinical trials.

About Sitravatinib

Sitravatinib is an investigational, spectrum-selective receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that can potentially stimulate the body’s immune response to fight cancer. Sitravatinib targets the VEGFR and TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK) receptor families which are implicated in orchestrating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Inhibiting these receptors stimulates the anti-tumor immune response and potentially re-sensitizes patients to checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy in patients who previously developed resistance to CPI therapy. By targeting specific RTKs with sitravatinib, the immunosuppressive TME is converted to an immune-supportive TME, and combining with CPI therapy may help regain an immune response potentially overcoming resistance to CPI therapy. Sitravatinib is being evaluated in multiple clinical trials, including the Phase 3 SAPPHIRE study, in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who are resistant to CPI therapy, and certain patients who are naïve to CPI therapy.

It's managed with powerful and expensive inflammatory medications with a high 1-year failure rate. 

The impact of this is cost to healthcare providers on medication that isn't working but, most importantly, bad outcomes for patients who can spend years on the wrong drug, developing irreversible bowel damage necessitating surgery only to relapse after a few years. 

Everything about managing IBD is difficult especially drug development. Restrictive FDA criteria around endoscopic evidence of inflammation reduces recruitment (0.1 patients per site per month) making trials hugely expensive. This also means patients with sub-types of IBD like Crohn's Disease (that affects the small bowel) can be entirely missed from studies leading to a homogenisation of therapeutic assets at market serving a narrow population of patients. 

In summary, despite more drugs than ever in IBD outcomes are creeping forward at an unsatisfactory rate hampered by slow and inefficient research and trials and an absence of personalised medicine with the therapies we do have access to.","Motilent's objective is to get the right IBD patient on the right treatment at the right time. 

We have tackled this by developing a multi-modality platform called Entrolytics that brings together endoscopy, MRI, ultrasound and histopathology data as well as providing an surface for PRO's and expert annotations to be held and, importantly, shared in a highly structured and regulated way. 

Entrolytics is currently used my many of the worlds IBD KOLs at Mt Sinai, AUMC, KU Leuven, UCL, MasGen, May, Cincinnati and Cleveland across 130 projects. The platform is extraordinarily powerful for running complex multi-centre trials and, crurically, very cost effective obviating the need for a formal CRO. In the past 6 months over $15M in grant backed projects have started migrating data to Entrolytics. 

Through Entrolytics we also see opportunities for bespoke developed which we can then, as a medical device manufacturer, develop and FDA clear/ CE mark for clinical use. An example of this is GIQuant (and objective marker for small bowel Crohn's) currently in used in a growing number of UK, EU and US institutions e.g. UCL, GOSH, Stanford, Wisconsin Children's etc. 

Our vision is to strategically migrate our research services towards clinical use where Entrolytics will one day serve as the single platform for IBD use.

For the lack of better information on individual status and disease progression, most disease management programs targert the ""average"" patient and have to assume everyone has similar needs as the ""average"" patient. Apparently, managing the ""average"" is inefficient, ineffective and being treated as the ""average"" is not satisfying.

To better understand individual health status and needs, we deploy devices that are low cost, low power and wireless to track medication adherence, behaviors and symptoms. Monitoring devices can be selected according to individual needs to ensure the relevancy of the data and personalization. Because many of the devices used, such as wearables, pillbox, don't require regulatory approval, the cost of generating and aggregating data is low.    Once data from various sources are aggregated and centralized? advanced algorithms and big data analytics can be developed to   track the health status of individuals and different patient populations to capture early abnormalities.

Patients are typically asymptomatic at early stages and diagnosed at a late stage when metastasis is rapid and mortality rates are high. Early diagnosis is the key to allowing patients to receive effective treatment and improving survival in these patients. MBMbio is developing novel liquid biopsy technologies to address the problem of early lung cancer diagnosis.","MBMbio’s solution to early lung cancer diagnosis is dependent on three related technology developments as described below:
1. Red blood cells as a new source of cancer biomarkers: Most cancer liquid biopsy technologies are based on biomarkers found in blood plasma, including cfDNA, and CTCs. However, these biomarkers are not easily detected in early stage cancers because they are typically released from tumor tissue at a later stage of the disease. We reasoned that RBCs might be a better source of cancer biomarkers because they can be found in close proximity with cancer cells during early oncogenesis, thus allowing transfer of cancer derived molecules that can serve as biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. Our R&D team has conducted in vitro experiments to show that there is a transfer of oncogene genetic mutations from cancer cell lines to co-incubated red blood cells. More importantly, we also have preliminary proof of concept clinical data showing that red blood cells, collected from early stage lung cancer patients (n=28), contains detectable DNA fragments that carry genetic mutations in EGFR and KRAS. 
2. RNA 2’-O-Methylation (Nm) sequencing: RNA Nm modification is a form of epigenomics that is increasingly recognized as an important regulator of RNA biology. One of the bottlenecks in the field is a reliable method to conduct high throughput sequencing of Nm modification. Our R&D team has developed a gentler and less labor-intensive enzyme-based method that can be applied to all classes of RNA molecules including rRNA, tRNA and mRNA, and in various tissues and cell types. We also have evidence to show that our Nm sequencing technology can be used to detect changes in Nm modification in a variety of biological contexts such as virus infection and cancer. In pilot experiments, we have used this technology for biomarker discovery in early lung cancer patients, discovering an mRNA Nm modifications signature that can accurately differentiate between stage I lung cancer and controls (n=35).
3. Omics data processing algorithm: Our R&D team has also developed an algorithm to screen large genomic datasets and select a minimal features signature panel that can be used to stratify samples. This is an important component in developing affordable diagnostics as it dramatically lessens the amount of targets that need to be detected. This technique has been used in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma and cutaneous melanoma patient samples to select biomarkers that have prognostic value. We recently performed DNA 5mC sequencing on RBC patient samples collected from early stage lung cancer patients (n=95, including 60 with lung nodules less than 1cm), then used our algorithm to select a four feature panel that had an AUC = 0.97.

Based on all our preliminary data, we are aiming to develop an early lung cancer diagnostic panel at very reasonable cost that is based on RBC+RNA Nm/DNA 5mC+Algorithm. Subsequently, this methodology can be extended to other early stage cancers.

Based on the technology’s performance and the needs of the sports medicine market, there are a number of key value propositions to our business. So far, surgeons interviewed or who have worked with the device experimentally found the product easier to use than existing products, which could lead to more treatments in a year. Because the device can be implanted arthroscopically, procedure can be done in surgical center with same day recovery. This means that treatment can 1) be a more attractive option for patients and 2) surgeons can do the procedure in their own outpatient facilities instead of hospitals. The material itself is relatively low cost and works with existing, scalable 3D printing technology, meaning that the device unit cost is low and the margin high, so the downstream procedure will costs less money. This also means that the center for Medicare services and insurance companies should issue a CPT code or allow Nanochon to leverage existing codes for grafts and implants. Finally, the recovery time for patients will be quicker than graft and cadaver tissue treatments. This means that the surgeon can potentially treat more patients in a year and attract new patients to their practice.","The device is based on 3D printing and a novel, nano-structured, synthetic material. Together, proprietary 3D designs and the material enable Nanochon to create an implant which is effectively “artificial” cartilage. The device works by replacing lost or damaged cartilage immediately, while also causing new tissue growth and healing long term. This provides two key benefits 1) patients are able to have shorter, less involved and more successful recovery and 2) have an effective treatment that lasts for years. The device has other unique characteristics too. Because of the durability of the material, and the flexibility provided by a 3D printed part (as opposed to traditional manufacturing) the device is highly malleable. This means that a large, 1.5 cm to 2 cm implant can be rolled up and fit through an arthroscope. And once inside the joint space, a surgeon can easily form the implant into place and tack it down using surgical sutures or pins. Currently graft tissue and other treatments of this size cannot be implanted arthroscopically, meaning patients have to undergo a longer, more invasive procedure with a much longer recovery time.  The device was recently trialed in a goat model, where a 1 cm (large) cartilage defect was treated in the knee. Animals recovered and were walking for 4 months. Removed samples saw the most effective recovery compared to microfracture, and true cartilage growth was observed vs. scar tissue.","3D Printing, Cell Therapy, Chronic Pain, Clinical Research, Flexible Manufacturing, Sports Medicine, Biomaterials, Longevity","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Nanochon","Yes","No",""

The annual cost to the US of nonadherence with prescriptions is estimated to exceed $300 billion annually. Significant efforts have been made to solve this problem with sustained-release drug delivery technologies. However, despite billions of dollars spent in research and development over the past few decades, a simple and practical solution to support the long-term treatment of many diseases has not been found. The availability of a technology that meets this need would be transformative for patients, doctors, and payers, and it would offer a major improvement in the quality of life of patients who must take medication frequently. 

Of specific interest is the opioid crisis facing many communities. According to recent estimates, there are 2.5 million people with opioid use disorder in the U.S. Approximately 20 percent of this population is addicted to illicit opioids, such as heroin, and the other 80 percent to prescription opioids, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, etc.  Recent efforts have attempted to treat moderate to severe opioid use order using a drug called buprenorphine.

The targeted implantation time is six months and potentially longer depending on the properties of the BUP formulation.  The nStrada™ devices rely on diffusion (passive or controlled) to achieve steady-state drug concentrations within a few days and then maintain constant release for the duration of the implant.  This behavior is a significant improvement over polymer-based implants and depots which suffer from an initial burst release and multiple weeks or months to achieve steady-state concentrations.

With annual healthcare costs of ~$31B, $17B to Medicare alone, and the current monitoring care continuum only has two primary end points; at the low end, a Bluetooth/wifi-enabled scale, and at the other end of the spectrum, the CardioMEMS implantable chip -- a device that costs tens of thousands of dollars and is struggling with reimbursement.   Many companies have tried to tackle CHF disease management through both implantable and non-invasive devices, mostly focused on trans-thoracic impedance. However, no single company has shown success rates of alert monitoring to worsening CHF; such alerts would allow medical professionals and patients to titrate their medication, alter diet, activity, etc., before lagging symptoms appear. This is the problem of looking at trans-thoracic impedance alone -- fluid accumulation is a lagging indicator and while there is a window of 24-48hrs to alter medication before symptoms severely worsen, there needs to be an approach that can better the 24-48 hr window as this window has not proven to reduce recidivism or increase patient compliance.  Novel, unobtrusive solutions are needed to monitor CHF patients outside of the hospital in an effort to catch and treat potential subsequent events ahead of major deterioration in patient health, resulting in repeated hospitalization. For many patients, titration of diuretic medication is the key mitigate to preventing fluid accumulation in the thoracic cavity and likely hospitalization.   As healthcare costs continue to skyrocket, and pressure from payors / CMS continue to push for remote monitoring solutions over in-patient care, CHF and other chronic diseases will be a primary focus for industry incumbents and start-ups.

As a central signaling hub in many central cellular processes, previous approaches to therapeutic targeting of mTOR have not achieved sufficient specificity to enable broad therapeutic application.","Navitor’s proprietary understanding of the nutrient sensing pathway that selectively regulates mTORC1 activity – and the protein sensors recognizing specific nutrients that constitute this pathway – uniquely enables the discovery of therapeutics that specifically target the dysregulation of mTORC1 activity in human disease. Navitor’s drug discovery efforts have identified  highly specific drug candidates that both activate and inhibit mTORC1 activity to address a broad range of diseases with high unmet medical need caused by aberrant mTORC1 activity. 
Navitor’s lead drug program, NV-5138, targets Sestrin2, a newly discovered amino acid sensor for the branched chain amino acid leucine, and is designed to directly activate mTORC1 activity in neurons to promote synaptogenesis and normalize mood. It is being developed as a rapid-acting anti-depressant to address treatment-resistant depression (TRD).
Navitor’s pipeline also includes programs that directly target the mTORC1 complex as well as other nutrient sensors to restore appropriate mTORC1 activity in multiple settings including renal fibrosis, neurological as well as immunometabolism and select rare diseases.
Fibrosis Renal:Hyperactive mTOR pathway activity has been demonstrated in myofibroblasts found in fibrotic foci in the kidney. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of mTOR can prevent activation of myofibroblasts and secretion of extracellular matrix in experimental models and prevent fibrosis. Navitor’s fibrosis program targets the selective inhibition of mTORC1 signaling through a novel direct inhibitor of the mTORC1 complex with unprecendented selectivity which might be the critical factor in the protection of certain cell types such as podocytes which have been showsn to be sesitive to the inhibitionof mTORC2 with current mTOR targetted drugs. 
Neurodegeneration: Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases are neurodegenerative diseases that involve abnormal protein folding, possibly due to excessive and unrestrained protein synthesis and a reduced ability to remove misfolded proteins through autophagy. Navitor’s therapeutic approach specifically targeting mTORC1 can specifically reduce protein synthesis while initiating autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, which are considered important in regulating the production of abnormal proteins that are thought to be involved in disease initiation and/or progression.","","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Navitor_Pharmaceuticals,_LLC","No","No",""

Of these cases approximately 20% are operable by surgical resection. The reminder of cases are treated primarily by thermal ablation (RF or Microwave) or by radio and chemotherapy. Radio and chemotherapy present significant side effects. Conversely thermal ablations do not present side effects and can be practiced percutaneously in a minimally invasive fashion. One limiting factor of thermal ablation is that it is challenging to judge under CT or Ultrasound guidance whether the tumor has been treated completely or only partially. Because of this, for medium-sized tumors, in approximately 24% of cases the ablation is incomplete, leading to recurrence.","NE Scientific is developing a software for surgical guidance which will support the physicians in targeting tissues, potentially ensuring that all malignant tissues are eradicated and that the treatment is successful.

The computed boundary is shown fused to CT or Ultrasound images to ensure that physicians are aware of which tissues they have treated and which not.

In general, following the development of a complication treatment is late as there is a delay period during which we wait for symptoms to present themselves before examination begins, which is finally followed by treatment. Anastomotic leakage, or the leakage of gastrointestinal fluid into the abdominal cavity, is one such complication that can develop after surgery. Anastomotic leaks are of particular concern, as they occur in approximately 130,000 high-risk abdominal surgery patients annually in the US with a 10-15% mortality and adverse outcomes for the survivors. Anastomotic leaks can occur at any time in the weeks following surgery. This renders current detection techniques, which rely on infrequent monitoring by a medical professional and unreliable diagnostic tests, costly and ineffective. These practices, which often result in late detection and delayed patient care, heavily contribute to the hospital-borne cost of $28M USD per 1000 high-risk abdominal surgery patients.

Early detection of anastomotic leaks can significantly improve patient outcomes, a goal that NERv's team is working towards.

Our most advanced programs utilize gene therapy to deliver a healthy copy of a gene by an AAV vector to the site of interest to override a gene defect that causes disease. In partnership with our academic collaborators, Neurogene has a strong body of pre-clinical proof of concept data.

Our lead gene therapy indications include:

o	Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU):  An ultra-rare autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease that is most prevalent within the Finnish population (1:18,000 births). While less prevalent outside of Finland, AGU has been documented across multiple ethnicities and reported globally.  People with AGU have a genetic mutation in the AGA gene that limits production or activity of a key metabolic protein (AGA), which results in the buildup of a toxic substrate that fuels neurodegeneration and causes a progressive decline in cognition, motor function, and other abnormalities that ultimately lead to a shortened lifespan of 20-40 years of age. Children with AGU experience an abnormally high rate of infections under the age of 5 and present with global developmental delay in early childhood.

o	Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT): CMT disease is a group of inherited peripheral neuropathies that affect as many as 1 in 2,500 people.  Neurogene is addressing CMT4J, a rare form of CMT. CMT4J is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the FIG4 gene that results in demyelinating motor and sensory neuropathy. Individuals with CMT4J typically develop symptoms of leg weakness in early childhood, and early onset disease is associated with a rapidly progressive course, ultimately leading to loss of ambulation, quadriplegia, respiratory compromise and early death.  Later onset disease has a more variable course that can lead to transient muscle weakness for some patients, while others develop a rapidly progressive reminiscent of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 

o	Other Lysosomal Storage Diseases (LSD):  Neurogene is developing a series of unique gene therapy products for rare disorders collectively referred to as lysosomal storage diseases. LSDs result from a defect in a gene involved with maintenance of the lysosome, a cellular component that shuttles proteins and other cellular factors to neighboring cells and also removes toxic material from cells. When the genetic defect arises, toxic material builds up in the cell and can lead to multiple-organ defects depending on the implicated gene and the extent of the defect.

Developing a ‘universal’ or ‘off-the-shelf’ T cell product from healthy donor tissue (allogeneic) would constitute a vertical advance in the field and would significantly reduce costs and expand the number of patients eligible for this treatment.","Our technology is based off of the well-defined biology of notch signaling to drive T cell differentiation.

Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a predominant contributor (~40%) to the genesis of spinal pain frequently manifesting as debilitating chronic lower back and neck pain, is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and accounts for the highest number of disability-adjusted life years worldwide with enormous associated socio-economic burden and clinical costs.  It is estimated that approximately 25% of the population in United States of America suffers from lower back and neck pain at costs greater than $100 billion annually. There are currently no approved disease-modifying treatments for DDD, with treatment options being primarily limited to pain relief (largely opioid prescriptions) and/or highly invasive and costly surgeries such as spinal fusions, and there are certainly no treatments capable of halting the progression of degenerative disc disease and promoting repair and regeneration of the disc.","Notogen’s lead product candidate, NTG-101, is a novel, disease-modifying biologic therapy for DDD that has been specifically designed from more than 20 years of study into the cause of DDD.

This pioneering research has led to a novel approach to nerve regeneration that is applicable to a number of CNS disorders and diseases, including spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis and glaucoma.","The failure of brain and spinal cord tissue to regenerate after trauma or disease is due, in large part, to inhibitory factors contained in the central nervous system (CNS). Overcoming the inhibition caused by these factors represents a high-value approach to restoring the natural regenerative capacity of these tissues, which would address a major unmet need in a variety of neuro-pathologies. Inhibitory molecules identified in the CNS vary widely in both composition and receptor interactions, making targeting of individual inhibitory factors impractical for therapeutic purposes. Despite the heterogeneity of these molecules, all known inhibitory factors appear to converge onto a shared cell signal, the hyperactivation of the small GTP-ase RhoA. While targeting of RhoA has shown utility for restoring the regenerative capacity of CNS tissue, the lack of specificity for such approaches leads to ubiquitous RhoA blockade, which results in a suppression of important endogenous functions that can cause toxicity. As such, a therapy capable of blocking the unwanted RhoA activity without disrupting beneficial, endogenous functions represents a means by which to maximize therapeutic benefits while minimizing unwanted toxic effects.","Novoron’s approach to promotion of neuroregeneration centralizes on the discovery of a previously unappreciated signaling pathway unique to pathological activation of RhoA, which results in regenerative failure. In disrupting this pathway, we are able to selectively attenuate the signaling that leads to regenerative arrest without affecting the critical endogenous functions of RhoA and its interactome. In addition, our agent actively crosses the blood-brain barrier, allowing for bioavailability to areas of need. The selectivity and bioavailability of our approach represents a substantial improvement over other Rho effectors or agents that target factors downstream of RhoA.

While the therapeutic potential of our technology has potential in a variety of conditions, Novoron is currently focusing development for use in spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis where failed regeneration of damaged CNS tissue is the greatest unmet need.","MS, Multiple Sclerosis, Spinal Cord Injury, Biologics, Regenerative Medicine, Rho, RhoA","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Novoron_Bioscience","No","No",""

Having to make trade-offs when choosing a protein production host costs researchers valuable time and money, delaying their sometimes life-saving treatments.  In bacterial protein production platforms, which are typically the most desirable due to their fast fermentation and low cost of growth, purification and other downstream processes account for over half and often up to 75% of the total costs to make a protein. Fragile proteins are damaged or destroyed during the purification process or must be untangled from solid masses called inclusion bodies adding time, hassle, and unnecessary costs to an otherwise simple and easy to use platform. And while the most popular alternative system, mammalian cells, solve this purification issue by expressing and secreting high purity proteins, they also increase the production time of a protein batch from 2 days to 2 weeks, a 7 fold increase. Expensive growth factors and growth media can increase the cost of making proteins in mammalian cells by 5-7 times the cost to do it in bacteria. Because dozens of batches are needed to optimize a protein from benchtop to commercial manufacturing scale, these extra time and material costs can delay a biopharmaceutical drug up to 2 years, keeping life-saving treatments from patients that need them now.","Opera Bioscience has developed a technology that solves both of these problems by combining the best characteristics of bacterial and mammalian cells.

This allows researchers to produce classes of proteins in a bacterial expression system that would otherwise be made in a slower, more expensive mammalian cell, allowing researchers to create proteins that normally do not express well do to toxicity.

Our first indication is Huntington?s disease, a debilitating, progressive and ultimately fatal disorder caused by a genetic mutation. We have already identified small molecules that reduce the toxic mutated protein, suppress mutant protein-induced toxicities in human disease neurons and get into the brain. We anticipate that this approach will be broadly applicable to traditionally ?undruggable? targets in other neurological diseases.","There are no effective treatments to slow, halt, prevent or reverse neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s (HD), Alzheimer’s (AD), Parkinson’s (PD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Current classes of approved drugs treat a narrow subset of disease symptoms while offering little for preventing, slowing or halting disease. The current pipeline of drugs in development focuses primarily on treating physical symptoms such as cognitive, psychiatric, or motor deficits or on treating biochemical symptoms such as protein aggregation, mitochondrial abnormalities or synaptic dysfunction. Even those clinical trials that have addressed what is thought to be the underlying cause of disease have failed. As a result of these failures, thought leaders have posed the problem in terms of needing to understand the right biology, generate the right drug activity, and test in the right patient population at the right time/ stage of disease. Neurodegenerative diseases represent a huge medical burden on society that is expected to steadily increase from 2020-2050. Globally, the market for neurodegenerative diseases is expected to exceed $45 billion by 2022.","Origami’s approach is to (1) focus on genetic diseases, (2) use small molecule therapeutics to fix the mutated disease-causing protein and (3) leverage natural history of the disease to select which patients to treat, when to intervene and what clinical outcomes to measure. Origami is using a proprietary platform of assays to discover kinetic conformation stabilizers for misfolded proteins. Huntington’s disease (HD) represents an ideal disease to test this approach, in that the genetic defect is clearly understood. Using a proprietary screen, we have identified and are testing small molecules to confirm that they restore normal function to mutant huntingtin. The HD market has been projected to be $2.6B by 2024, based primarily on the current pipeline of symptomatic treatments.

A large hospital with more than 90 active ORs such as the Houston Methodist has a large number of different procedures per day and per OR that needs to be scheduled several weeks in advance. Each procedure requires gathering a team led by a surgeon for a specific block of time in the OR. But even the most standard procedure such as a cholecystectomy, that account for about 800 000 cases per year in the USA, exhibits a significant variation in time duration. It has been recognized that OR time is one of the most significant budget chapter in a modern hospital. It has also been shown that delays in OR procedures due to lapses in scheduling and/or OR resources availability has been responsible for increased failures in surgery outcome. The OR is one of the most complex high tech settings, but there is still not an automatic feedback loop between the surgical team and the OR system that would allow real time adjustment of previously made decisions in scheduling. Today, the surgical staff exchange information through direct channels such as conversation, text messages, phone calls and centralized EMR (Electronic Medical Record) computer system; Collaborative work such as rescheduling cases, updating OR information and emergency cases is performed using a whiteboard to support case scheduling through the day. Today hospital system such as EPIC may stream line the process but are not patient centric neither provide friendly collaborative tools to address optimum management of multiple ORs in real time.   To fit J&J strategy, ORintel will focuss on orthopedic surgery in private specialized clinic with high volume of knee replacements:   our goal is to install a cost-effective staff friendly cyber-infrastructure and use a mathematical system science approach to increase surgical flow performance. In practice, we would like to help the clinic to achieve 4 cases per 8 hours shift half of the time, increasing the number of procedure per OR from 3 to 3.5. This is a very ambitious goal and partial success toward that goal will be already significant. Assuming that the net revenue for an orthopedic case is about $3,000, our system should increase the revenue of a clinic specialized in joint replacement with 10 ORs of about: 5*3,000*250 = $ 3,750,000 per year.

Early intervention is critical to prevent worsening infection.  There is no product or device available to continuously monitor wounds for rising bacteria load indicating infection. Early notification of infection enables early intervention, which can improve patient outcomes and save millions of dollars of healthcare cost due to amputation, antibiotic overuse, sepsis, and death.

Chronic Wounds: 
Infection in chronic wounds is a major cause of lower limb amputation and patient death; driving hospital admittance and $96.8 billion of cost into the U.S healthcare system. Globally, care of chronic wounds consumes 3% of healthcare budgets. In the USA, 29 million people and 25.9% of persons aged ?65 years have diabetes.  At least 1 in 4 will develop Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU), which are predisposed to infection. DFU infection has a five-year 30.5% mortality rate compared to all forms of cancer at 31.0%. Early detection of infection is paramount to avoid further complications and loss of lower limbs.

Burn Wounds: 
The American Burn Association states that roughly 450,000 patients receive hospital and emergency room treatment for burns each year. This statistic does not account for burn injuries treated in hospital clinics, private medical offices, or community health centers. Of these burn injuries, roughly 3,400 burn injury deaths occur each year in the USA. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), burns and fires are the third leading cause of death in the home. Wound dressings are often extremely painful to remove, particularly for severe burn wounds. The removal of these dressings can peel away the fresh and fragile skin that is making contact with the dressing, causing extreme pain and prolonged recovery time. There is also a greater risk for infection and the onset of sepsis, which is fatal to 15-72% of afflicted patients, depending on severity, intervention, and patient age.

HAIs:
Central lines are a commonly performed procedure, with approximately 8 percent of hospitalized patients requiring central venous access. More than five million central venous catheters (CVCs) are inserted in the United States each year. CVC-related infections can significantly influence the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stays, hospital costs, and mortality rates (up to 25 %). Early detection of infection is paramount to impeding the possibility of sepsis. 

The demand for total knee and hip arthroplasty has exploded in the United States and is projected to grow 174% for total hip arthro?plasty (THA) and 673% for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to total almost four million annual combined procedures by 2030. Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is reported between 2% and 0.4% for patients undergoing TKA in a Medicare population of 69,663 patients within two years and between two to 10 years, respectively. While literature on risk of deep infection with presence of superficial wound infection after total joint arthroplasty is mixed, the signs of superficial wound infections such as surgical site infections and prolonged drainage may lead to a 35 times increased risk of deep PJI. Early detection of infection is essential to impede possible onset of sepsis.

DoD Related Wounds: 
DoD anticipates that future conflicts may reflect the casualty volumes experienced in large scale combat operations such as WWI and WWII. Additionally, the current paradigm of rapid global evacuation may not be possible due to the anti-access and area-denial conditions imposed by the modern landscape of multi-domain operations. Hence, prolonged field care (PFC) of polytraumatic wounds (e.g., blast wounds) for indeterminant periods in field conditions significantly increases susceptibility to infection caused by multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs). Multiple microorganisms (ESKAPEE & other bacteria, fungi) involved in mass casualty and combat wound infections exhibit complex pathogenesis and are becoming more and more resistant to multiple, sometimes all, antibiotics through various mechanisms.

Mass casualty events among civilian populations will create greater dependency on resource limited PFC increasing the number of potential deaths from polytraumatic wounds as infection rate rises within 72 hours. In both military and civilian populations under 36 years of age, trauma injury exceeds all other causes of death combined, where sepsis is the greatest danger after hemorrhage. Sepsis caused by infection in trauma wounds results in mortality in the range of 19.5–23 %. The annual public health cost in the U.S exceeds $406 Billion.","ParaNano Wound Care, LLC has developed a prototype biosensor, the Nanosheet™ Biosensor, as a wearable bioactive membrane of radially cross-aligned, “smart” nanofibers capable of continuously monitoring a wound for 72 hours and beyond. Targeted for use in both clinical and low resource environments, military and civilian, the single-use biosensor delivers “fire and forget” detection of rising bacterial load and presents a vivid colorimetric indication of infection at a critical threshold of bacterial presence in a prolonged care (PC) setting. Antibiotics have been described by the CARB-X community as “the fire extinguisher of medicine.” The Nanosheet™ Biosensor can be considered the “smoke detector” that alerts the patient and care provider “there is a fire.” The Nanosheet™ Biosensor enables early detection of an infection and timely intervention, deterring unnecessary use of antibiotics that may contribute to antimicrobial resistance.


Key features of the Nanosheet™ Biosensor:
?	Wearable continuous, monitoring over periods exceeding 72 hours until membrane color change or removal;
?	Bioactive nanofiber in the membrane incorporates a dye responsive in a chemical reaction to pathogen lipase;
?	Colorimetric response is tunable for bacteria detection within 30 minutes to two hours of biosensor exposure; 
?	Light weight (less than an ounce), pliable and conformable sheets sizeable for coverage of trauma wounds;
?	Flexible protective packaging, with package dimensions less than a credit card and 0.25inch thickness;
?	Useable right out of the package, direct on wound placement providing essential “fire and forget” capability;
?	Highly reliable with failure mode being primarily package damage or contamination during field application;
?	Minimum logistical support is needed – no swabs, batteries, cartridges, microneedles, pumps, or catheters;
?	Minimal training for application, with color change indication of infection perceptible even if color blind;
?	Usable as a point-of-care assay to detect bacterial presence at a critical level in spent wound dressings;
?	Usable as a companion product for a range of wound care applications including diabetic ulcers, pressure injury, surgical wounds, and burns;
?	Integration into existing wound care products (e.g. BIOPATCH® or DERMABOND™ PRINEO™ Skin Closure System) adds pathogen detection functionality;
?	Usable under standard dressings or DoD Bandage Packs carried in the IFAK (Improved First-Aid Kit).

Feasibility Proven: 
Chromogenic, bioactive nanofiber membranes have been successfully fabricated and tested against critical thresholds of MRSA, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli- demonstrating the color change within 30 minutes to 2 hours. A novel and scalable manufacturing process to create the membranes has been developed and tested- creating 10cm x 22.5cm membranes. 

Projected Pricing: 
The Nanosheet™ will be priced per sq cm. 
Price points will be around $4.20 based on our current understanding of the manufacturing process. This is subject to change, and we anticipate a lower price point as we leverage economies of scale. 

Mechanism of Action: 
The nanofiber membrane is comprised of PU, PVP & a proprietary HCy dye. The dye interacts with the bacterial lipase, our unique biomarker, and triggers the color change at the critical threshold, indicating infection.","biosensor, nanofiber, chromogenic, therapeutic, antimicrobial, electrospinning, wound care, diagnostic, ESKAPEE pathogens, burn wounds, chronic wounds, diabetic foot ulcers, hospital-acquired infections, central line infections","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/ParaNano_Wound_Care,_LLC","No","Yes",""

This crisis accelerates every year, and by 2050 it is expected that AMR will lead to 10 million annual deaths globally. Despite the critical need for new antibiotics to fight this unseen pandemic, a new antibiotic class has not been discovered in over 30 years. In the past two decades, pharmaceutical companies have largely exited the space due to the lack of financial incentives surrounding antibiotic research and development. A further challenge is bridging the “valley of death” between discovery and preclinical research where most drugs fail, particularly when developing novel compounds that target highly resistant pathogens, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. 

We believe that challenging market incentives can no longer justify inaction against AMR. Phare Bio is deeply committed to tackling the most urgent bacterial threats with our unique technology and approach.","Phare Bio is developing new classes of antibiotics against highest-priority pathogens with few, if any, available therapeutic options, especially those identified as urgent threats by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC). With an innovative AI platform and nonprofit business model, Phare Bio is uniquely positioned to address the current challenges surrounding antibiotic development. 

The use of philanthropic funding significantly de-risks the drug development process and allows Phare to target particularly difficult pathogens in translational and early preclinical research. This allows Phare to design target product profiles that address society’s most urgent medical needs, even if those products wouldn’t be considered commercial blockbusters in the traditional pharmaceutical R&D setting. More specifically, we will target the pathogens projected to contribute most significantly to human morbidity and mortality over the next 30 years. According to the WHO, these are: (1) Escherichia coli, (2) Klebsiella pneumoniae, (3) Acinetobacter baumannii, (4) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, (5) Neisseria gonorrhoeae, (6) Staphylococcus aureus, and (7) Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Along with our nonprofit structure, our model further accelerates and de-risks the antibiotic development process by deploying machine learning for early discovery. In partnership with MIT and the Broad Institute, Phare Bio uses novel AI/deep learning to identify drug compounds with antibiotic properties. The algorithm prioritizes the identification of compounds with targeted activity and novel mechanisms of action. The use of AI not only accelerates the speed and enhances the precision of discovery but also requires much less capital that would otherwise be spent on very time-consuming and hands-on traditional high-throughput screening approaches. With a portfolio of AI-generated compounds, Phare Bio’s team of translational experts performs the necessary medicinal chemistry and hit-to-lead/lead optimization studies required to assess compound viability in the preclinical, clinical, and commercial phases.

We believe that this unique business model and the use of cutting-edge AI technology can directly address urgent challenges surrounding antibiotic development. With the right partners, both in the non-profit and for-profit sectors, we believe that we can scale this model to become an industry leader and deliver a pipeline of treatments that address some of the most pressing needs in infectious disease.","Antibiotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, antimicrobial resistance, anti-infectives","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Phare_Bio","No","No",""

But for certain locally advanced tumors, such as brain, lung, esophageal and head and neck cancers, there is a very high rate of therapy failures that leads to disease progression and death.  In spite of significant advances on the instrumentation side of radiation oncology and the ability to wrap the radiation beam around a tumor, radiation oncologists are frustrated that there is no way to improve the therapeutic index.  The higher the dose of radiation, the more likely you are to kill the tumor. But this comes at tremendous cost to the patient in the form of life altering or life threatening side effects.  Often,  the radiation oncologist reaches the limits of what the patient can tolerate before achieving a cure.","Gold nanoparticles have been tried as radiosensitizers in the past and failed.  They were effective from a therapeutic standpoint, but safety issues have prevailed.  Nanoparticles in the range of 80-100nm are needed to achieve uptake and retention in the tumor to get a good therapeutic effect.  Unfortunately, they are not excretable and can accumulate in sensitive organs like the liver, kidneys and spleen.  This can lead to potential toxicities in those organs.  Small gold nanoparticles that are easily excreted, (<5nm) are not retained long enough to get a therapeutic effect.  PolyAurum has embedded clusters of the small gold nanoparticles in a biodegradable polymer which therapeutically acts like a large gold nanoparticle and then as the polymer disintegrates, the gold is released and excreted.  In mouse models of glioblastoma and sarcoma, we have seen significantly improved survival in animals getting gold nanoparticles with RT versus those getting RT alone.  In some cases, complete and enduring disappearance of tumors has been observed.  Gold is also an excellent contrast agent which will enhance visualization of the tumors pre-RT for better planning and then post-RT to follow shrinkage and disappearance of tumors.  The polymer matrix is also capable of carrying a therapeutic payload which would allow multimodal attack on the tumor  (RT + drug).  There is also preliminary data showing uptake of the gold nanoparticles by M2 macrophages, which act as immunosuppressants.  We believe that elimination of these macrophages could potentially remove one of the components of the hostile tumor microenvironment which leads to IO therapy failure.","Therapeutic, Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Nanoparticles, Oncology, Diagnostic Imaging, Radiation Oncology","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/PolyAurum","No","No",""

Under normal physiological conditions, MMP activity is controlled in the body to maintain a healthy rate of tissue turnover; however, under pathophysiological conditions, MMPs activity is uncontrolled, wreaking havoc on tissue structure and function.  For example, in the joint of a patient with osteoarthritis (OA), MMP activity gradually wears away cartilage tissue resulting in joint pain and stiffness.  Similarly, following a myocardial infarction (MI), MMP activity in the infarct tissue breaks down the heart muscle, compromising heart function and ultimately leading to heart failure (HF).  Both of these tissues have a limited capacity to repair once tissue degradation has begun, and therefore progression of the disease is inevitable once a patient is diagnosed.  There are over 30 million people in the US with symptomatic OA, and over 3 million people in the US suffering from HF caused by MI.","In order to treat diseases where uncontrolled MMP activity contributes to disease progression including OA and heart disease, molecules that inhibit MMPs (MMPi’s) have been developed over the past 30 years.  While these molecules are potent inhibitors of MMPs, localizing their activity to the diseased tissue has been challenging.  Clinical trials were stopped when patients began experiencing systemic side effects after receiving oral or intravenous doses of the drugs.

In fact, it is projected that by the year 2050, 10 million patients will die from antibiotic resistant infections. Making matters worse is the discovery that biofilms, a community of bacteria encased in an extracellular matrix, account for up to 65 percent of infections.  Biofilms are tolerant to antibiotics and persist in the body despite treatment, leading to the development of more resistant bacteria.  In addition, biofilms are associated with chronic infections that cause lasting tissue damage even when the infection is finally cleared from the body.  Unfortunately, no antibiotic currently on the market combats bacteria within biofilms. Therefore, treatment of these infections requires invasive procedures like surgery to clear the infections. These problems have left a hole where ambitious research is required to discover and develop new antibiotics that fight antibiotic resistance and biofilm-forming bacteria. 

One key example is periprosthetic joint infection.  It is well-recognized that most orthopedic infections are caused by biofilm-forming bacteria and are extremely difficult to treat.  Therefore, orthopedic infections are a major area of unmet clinical need. Periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are the most common complication following total joint arthroplasty (TJAs). Unfortunately, due to the presence of biofilms, treatment requires prolonged, high-dose antibiotic therapy coupled with aggressive surgical lavage and debridement.  Nevertheless, treatment only succeeds in about half of patients leading to more surgeries, amputation, joint fusion, or death. Exacerbating this issue is the fact that the number of TJAs for knees and hips is only expected to rise, reaching nearly four million per year by 2030 and resulting in more projected PJIs.  As no treatment is currently available for PJI, a new product that combats biofilm-forming bacteria could be especially transformative.","We have developed a novel biologic derived from platelet-rich plasma, termed BIO-PLY, that combats bacteria using a multimodal approach.  Firstly, BIO-PLY is directly antibacterial against both antibiotic-resistant and biofilm-forming bacteria.  Secondly, BIO-PLY balances the host immune response to improve bacterial clearance while dampening exuberant inflammation.  Lastly, BIO-PLY improves tissue healing by promoting tissue regeneration.  BIO-PLY is a platform technology that combats infections unable to be cleared by traditional antibiotic therapies.  In doing so, BIO-PLY provides physicians with a novel treatment option that succeeds when antibiotics fail.

We began developing BIO-PLY to combat orthopedic infections where biofilm-forming bacteria are a well-established aspect of the pathophysiology.  In the area of periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) following total joint arthroplasty (TJA), we have shown that BIO-PLY combats the biofilms that form in synovial fluid, synovial tissue, and on orthopedic implant material.  We have also shown that BIO-PLY is capable of combating both antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant bacteria.  However, BIO-PLY does more than fight bacteria.  In our preclinical data, we have shown that BIO-PLY decreases neutrophilic inflammation and increases neutrophil-mediated killing of biofilms.  In addition, BIO-PLY dampens synovial tissue inflammation and promotes cartilage health in a non-implant associated joint infection.  When an implant is introduced, BIO-PLY can aid in osseointegration and protect the underlying bone from infection and inflammation.  In doing so, BIO-PLY provides results that surpass any treatment available leading to a truly transformative option for orthopedic surgeons dealing with PJIs post-TJA.","antibacterial, antibiofilm, immunomodulation, anti-inflammatory, regenerative, orthopedic infections, osteoarthritis, bone and joint infections, skin and soft tissue infections, wounds","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Qentoros_Inc","No","No",""

In addition, diagnostic detection of diseased cells can produce false positive results causing unnecessary therapeutic intervention and cost.  Furthermore, diagnostic false negative results can lead to disease progression at increased cost and patient suffering.  What is needed are highly cell- and disease-specific targeted antibodies to address these problems.  Rec?dagen’s proprietary discovery platform reveals cell- and disease-specific targets.  This platform is disruptive because we focus on long “noncoding” RNAs that are translated into protein.  Our technology incorporates diverse concepts and methods from multiple disciplines and is important for two main reasons.  First, these “noncoding” RNAs can be cell- and/or disease-specific.  Second, protein is more targetable than RNA in vivo.","Our proprietary combination of methods to express and detect novel proteins enabled the discovery of our lead, carcinoma-specific, targetable protein Migration inducting gene 7 (Mig7).  Surprisingly, Mig7 is expressed from what algorithms predict is a long “noncoding” RNA.  To date, detection of Mig7 is highly specific to lung, breast, endometrial and colon as well as other solid tumor type carcinomas but is not found in normal cells of humans past gestation. In fact, Mig7 is expressed in 98% of malignant carcinomas examined as well as detected in primary tumors, blood and at metastasized sites of cancer patients thereby providing broad opportunities for therapeutic intervention.  In addition, our laboratory and others have shown that Mig7 plays a significant role in carcinoma cell invasion, metastasis, vasculogenic mimicry.  Mig7 is expressed downstream of multiple cancer-causing signaling pathways involved in current drug resistance.  Our proof-of-principal data demonstrate that Mig7 biological therapies and reagents could meet our stated goals.

Disadvantages of traditional batch freeze-drying and relation to future pharmaceutical needs:
•	High production cost: need for large equipment with high operational, maintenance, energy and infrastructure costs because of the high standards of cleanliness and sterility, which are mandatory in production of biopharmaceuticals.
•	Time-consuming: the whole freeze-drying cycle may last 1 to 7 days depending on the product properties. One important cause is the unefficient energy supply from shelves to vials during drying.
•	Difficult upscaling: lab-scale -> pilot-scale -> production scale. Each step requires complete reoptimization and re-validation to meet Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards.
•	Impaired quality: sub-optimal processes (no in-line process monitoring and control at the scale of the individual vial) and complicated handling of vials for loading and unloading of the freeze dryer. Furthermore, since the handling equipment before (filling) and after (capping, packaging) freeze-drying is continuously operated by nature, buffer systems are necessary, increasing the risk of product contamination.

In response, Primary Care Providers (PCPs) are increasingly asked to monitor the behavioral health needs of patients, both in-clinic and in day-to-day life. The US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has deployed numerous incentives to integrate mental health treatment into primary care, but this has left a gap where over-burdened PCPs struggle to improve patient behavioral health outcomes, while keeping patients engaged and avoiding losses to follow-up.","Rose Health, founded in 2018, is a HIPAA-compliant, digital mental health platform that augments behavioral health management and improves collaborative care interoperability. Rose enables primary care providers to identify patients with behavioral health issues, recognize and address risk, and obtain reimbursement for their care through Behavioral Health CPT codes. Rose’s mobile app provides guided care journeys, customized to a patient’s needs through Rose’s patented AI and NLP algorithms and supported by clinical oversight from their provider. 

While patients are being supported through the app, Rose’s algorithms take hundreds of active data points and passive digital biomarkers, converting them into an objective, multi-dimensional “Rose Score” that is simple, actionable, and instantly understandable by clinicians. PCPs can remotely monitor their patients in real-time, identify early risk factors through the Rose Score, and effectively transition patients to mental health providers through our collaborative model. Rose increases patient-provider engagement, ultimately resulting in lower costs, reimbursed care for providers, and improved patient health outcomes. Our multi-pronged approach provides a smart solution to primary care-based mental health care while offering a favorable return on investment to providers. 

Rose has recently partnered with a national leading care navigational company that provides Rose’s patients with 24/7/365 access to one of 86 licensed clinical social workers (known as the Rose Concierge Care Team) for short-term therapy. The Rose Care Team can be reached within 10 seconds through a call from the app, and the Rose Care Team will triage the patient, conduct assessments to gauge the care pathway, offer short term counseling, provide health coaching, workforce skills development, and ultimately finding the patient a long-term therapist. Our Rose Care Team is able to match 50% of patients to a therapist for their first consultation in 3 days and has 98% of patients seen and matched within a 5-day period. This is a significant core competency in the space, especially given the average 3-month wait for patients to see a therapist, oftentimes at the risk of further decompensation and worsening outcomes.

Other focus areas for Rose include adolescent mental health, employee wellbeing, remote monitoring in psychiatry, and in-patient mental health programs. Success for us is when Rose is the model not only used among all patients seeking therapy but ubiquitously used to create networks aimed at building mental health resiliency at the population level. Our core ethos remains that mental well-being programs have to adapt to individual health needs, integrate into current care practices, and make optimal use of health system resources so as to improve health outcomes & reduce cost.","digital health, mental health, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, digital biomarkers","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Rose_Health","No","No",""

RNAi delivery challenges are currently addressed by two approaches: conjugation and nanoparticle encapsulation – and they come with significant downsides. Conjugation of RNAi with targeting moieties such as GalNac has enabled efficient delivery to the liver but is limited due to poor bioavailability with rapid metabolic clearance and the inability to deliver beyond the liver. Nanoparticle delivery approaches enhance the bioavailability, but the toxicity associated with the cationic lipids required for nucleic acid encapsulation, in addition to its instability in biological environments such as mucus and surfactant, limits their applicability. Current low-toxicity inhalation-based nucleic acid technologies incorporate polymers and lipids to overcome some of these lung-specific challenges. Polymer nanoparticle formulation can help penetrate through the mucus layer but is limited in effective delivery into the cells of interest and protection against RNases. Lipid-hybrid nanoparticle formulations may overcome the mucus layer but can lead to premature release of RNAi cargo, exposing to RNAses before reaching the cell.","Our platform, SAMiRNA, combines the advantages of conjugation and encapsulation strategies without any of their downsides to efficiently deliver to the lung via inhalation. Typical RNAi nanoparticle formulations are not stable enough to be effectively delivered to the lung using a nebulizer. Our SAMiRNA platform enables nebulizer-mediated delivery of RNAi to the lung. This is due to our ultra-stable, modularized design which doubly conjugates RNAi with hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends to self-assemble into a nanoparticle. Our design enables delivery across the mucus layers as well as protection from the RNases, surfactant-induced premature release of RNAi, and mechanical stresses introduced during ultrasound-induced vaporization. Using a fluorescence-tagged SAMiRNA, we showed effective delivery across the lung, including in the proximal and distal lung into the alveolar structures. Our preliminary data suggests that our lung inhalation-delivery platform did not cause any toxicity while effectively knocking down our target, as shown in our proof of concept study in the ferret COVID model (see non-conf).  Using our inhaler-delivered SAMiRNA lung platform, numerous pulmonary and respiratory conditions can be addressed with easier patient compliance and lower healthcare burden. While infusions are common, it leads to a significant burden on healthcare as the risk of complications increases with repeated dosages. Infusions limit treatable patients by age and access to infusion, whether it be vein access or physical access to IV lines. Inhalation enables organ-specific delivery and easy administration for all age groups.","siRNA, respiratory, CNS, inflammatory, fibrosis","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/siRNAgen_Therapeutics","Yes","No",""

One consequence of this is the increased incidence of aging-related diseases, including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and obesity; each leading to increased healthcare costs and compromising the length and quality of life for older adults. A central feature of aging is low-grade, chronic inflammation that occurs in the absence of infection, a phenomenon termed “Inflammaging”. Inflammaging is thought to be mediated by a shared set of mechanisms, including cellular senescence, activation of both the inflammasome and DNA damage response, as well as intestinal dysbiosis; changes in the structure of the microorganisms that reside within the human intestinal tract (the gut microbiota). The gut microbiota plays an integral role in regulating host immunity and inflammation through a variety of well-described mechanisms. A recent meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials utilizing probiotic supplementation found that orally administered microbes can significantly reduce systemic inflammatory biomarkers in human subjects, and there is evidence that probiotic organisms can also promote longevity in model organisms, including Caenorhabitis elegans. However, commercial probiotics are limited to a small number of bacterial and fungal species that have been used extensively, and novel sources of beneficial microbes are required to provide an opportunity for next generation probiotics, medical foods, and therapeutics to address systemic inflammation in the aging population.","The Solarea team will leverage its library of beneficial food-derived fungal and bacterial isolates to design and assemble novel Defined Microbial Assemblages (DMAs) expressing an array of beneficial mechanisms that modulate host immunity (including production of short chain fatty acids, aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists, and extracellular polymeric substances).

The system has two parts: 1) a hand-held device for detection and 2) disposable biosensor tubes that a patient blows into and are inserted into the hand-held device. The device uses patient breath and air flow to photonically amplify volatile organic compounds that are present in individuals who have early stage lung cancer, which is often left undetected on a CT scan, or if detected, is too late for treatment to be effective.  The specimen or sample is analyzed based on its binding to the biosensor. Once the sample is bound, it is irradiated by a trigger eliciting a release of photons. This photonic signal is then amplified within seconds in the device, and a result is presented to the user on the device. The patient blows into the device, and a positive or negative result is displayed. Additionally, volume of breath and magnitude of biomarker detected per liter is stored and sent to a computer or network. The biosensor breath tube is then disposed of and a new one is inserted for the next patient. The device is low cost and simple to use. Applications include normalizing very quick screening of patients in clinics during a routine check-up, in order to catch early-stage asymptomatic patients.","","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Steradian_Technologies,_Inc.","No","No",""

In addition, biologics are extremely sensitive to the manufacturing process and the starting materials, especially if it is a living cell that requires recombinant technology, make the process more complex than that for small molecules. Furthermore, biologic drugs tend to have high immunogenicity compared to small molecule drugs and often requires settings where patients need to be supervised while receiving treatment.

By leveraging powerful tools derived from machine learning and single cell bioinformatics, we are
developing technologies that enable a systematic in silico examination of T cell interactions with tumors in heterogeneous microenvironments. This allows us to generate novel strategies for engineering T cells specifically designed to target and combat solid tumors effectively.","CAR-T therapy has proven to be highly effective in treating liquid tumors, but it has yet to achieve a breakthrough for solid tumors. While researchers have primarily focused on the immune suppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME), less attention has been given to the heterogeneity of the TME. We believe this heterogeneity is the primary reason for variations in treatment outcomes between patients and tumor sites, as well as the limited overall efficacy.

The complexity of the TME in solid tumors makes the design of effective CAR-T therapies a multiscale challenge. It requires capturing not only intracellular signaling and gene regulation but also cell-cell interactions within the TME. Consequently, finding a successful solution demands the simultaneous interrogation of multiple factors across different scales, which traditional experimental approaches struggle to achieve. This underscores the need for a comprehensive, integrated approach to designing CAR-T therapies for solid tumors.

Traditional biological studies typically employ a reductionist approach, focusing primarily on individual components of a biological system rather than examining the system as a whole. This method may be helpful for interpreting bulk measurement results, where data is collected from large populations of cells. However, it also masks the heterogeneity present at the single-cell level and fails to provide deep insight into the dynamic nature of biological processes or offer a causal interpretation of interconnections and dependencies among various aspects of the biological system. Therefore, a novel approach to interpreting biology is essential for addressing the aforementioned challenges, one that goes beyond traditional methodologies to unveil the complexities of biological systems.","Synlico Inc. is at the forefront of developing cutting-edge technology for engineering T cell therapy in solid tumors. By leveraging the power of single-cell analysis, we are developing technologies that provide a comprehensive understanding of tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity across diverse tumor types and patients. This approach allows us to decipher the intricate interactions between T cells and other cells within the TME, encompassing both intercellular and intracellular dimensions, and identify shared patterns.

Our data-driven methodology harnesses machine learning and other computational techniques to construct a platform capable of effectively addressing the multiscale challenge. By assimilating information from various scales, our platform will be able to examine multiple factors and modulate
their impact on the behavior of T cells within different TMEs. This knowledge will ultimately lead to more effective treatments for solid tumors.

The vast majority of proteins function through interactions with other proteins to direct their localization, stability, and form larger complexes to achieve complex biological functions. Non-enzymatic proteins and protein-protein interactions have been considered ‘undruggable’ due to poor assay readouts and the difficulty of achieving activity with conventional small molecule library screening.","We apply an evolutionary approach to drug discovery. Our cell-based selection platforms, ToRPPIDO and ToRNeDO, identify compounds that modulate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) or lead to neosubstrate protein degradation, respectively, in a fast, efficient, and highly specific manner. We produce peptides from large encoded libraries and use stringent genetic circuitry to select for ones capable of the desired protein modulation using a functional readout. The approach allows for selection of compounds that either disrupt or bring together proteins of interest, for applications such as selective protein degradation. The platforms are broadly applicable, and our internal area of focus is oncology. Other indications are the subject of current pharma collaboration discussions.

Our target selection in oncology is based on the concepts of synthetic lethality and oncogene addiction. This strategy enables us to achieve cancer cell selectivity and specificity by targeting particular “Achilles’ heel” PPIs that are uniquely crucial for the survival and growth of cancer cells but not healthy tissues. Our family of stabilized peptides of the STX100 series, blocks a central PPI within the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway – components of this pathway are hyper-accumulated in many different types of biopsied drug-resistant cancer cells but are virtually undetectable in almost all healthy adult tissues. We have identified a unique interface on the target PPI, that when disrupted, triggers an acute and non-canonical cell death mechanism that we have discovered and characterized. This new cell death mechanism exploits the differential abundance of the HR target in cancer cells relative to normal tissue to elicit an acute calcium-dependent cell death upon binding of STX100 to its target.

However, despite this, patients with these viral-associated tumors have very few options when the standard of care fails.

These cells can recognize and kill infected cells while activating other parts of immune system for a coordinated response. VSTs persist in the body and activate a rapid immune response if the virus is encountered again.  VSTs can recognize viral antigens located on the surface of the tumor. After infusion, the VSTs migrate to the tumor site and bind to the viral antigens. The act of binding causes the release of cytotoxic granules from the VSTs that destroy the cancer cells.  We have also designed CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) expressing VSTs that combine the safety, durability, and persistence of VSTs with antigen specificity of a CAR.

It causes $1 trillion global cost in 2018, which will reach $2 trillion by 2030. 152 million patients are expected in 2050. Unfortunately, there is no treatment to AD and current research, based mostly on beta-Amyloid and phospho-Tau approach, is proving to be unsuccessful.","Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a multifactorial condition with a complex etiology that includes the modification of proteostasis and synaptic plasticity, increased inflammation, vascular alterations, Abeta-dependent cytotoxicity, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and cell cycle reentry in neurons. The ideal therapy should cover all these aspects, as they are the cause of neurodegeneration and cognitive loss.  Our target, the transcription factor E2F4, regulates the cell cycle as well as the expression of genes influencing neuronal welfare. E2F4 can be phosphorylated by p38MAPK in two conserved Thr residues, thus altering its function and promoting cell cycle reentry and neuronal tetraploidization, which can lead to Tau hyperphosphorylation, extracellular Abeta deposition, synaptic dysfunction, and gliosis. We have proved using transgenic mice that the neuronal expression of a dominant negative form of E2F4 (E2F4DN), unable to become phosphorylated in these Thr residues, prevents both neuronal tetraploidization and cognitive loss in 5xFAD mice (a known AD murine model), and induces a transcriptional program that promotes neuronal survival, axonal regeneration, synaptic plasticity, and memory enhancement in these mice. Furthermore, neuronal expression of E2F4DN in 5xFAD mice leads to the transcription of genes that facilitate vascular integrity, non-cytotoxic inflammatory response through Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM cells), and neuronal wellbeing facilitation. Therefore, we have developed a multifactorial approach against AD, thus making our solution unique.  Our therapy, based on an AAV-E2F4DN vector, which specifically induces E2F4DN expression in neurons, is fully effective in homozygous 5xFAD mice. It prevents neuronal tetraploidization and cognitive loss without side effects (mice show normal activity, absence of tumors, normal hepatic and spleen markers,...). In addition, this therapy results in reduced Abeta production and accumulation and improved long-term potentiation (the molecular basis of memory formation) even when the vector is administered when cognitive deficits are evident.

AGR2 is secreted only under pathological conditions (chronic stress of the epithelium) as a first stress signal. Once outside the cell, extracellular AGR2 gains new but deleterious functions: 
- it promotes inflammation by recruiting monocytes to the affected tissue,

However, and perhaps more concerning, 77% of patients examined preoperatively for cataract surgery demonstrated ocular surface disease findings, the great majority of whom were asymptomatic (PMID 28848324). This ocular surface disease can produce inaccurate calculations for the power of the intraocular lens to be implanted during cataract surgery, resulting in poor postoperative refractive outcomes. Remediation is possible, but only if this condition is detected before surgery. Current methods of detection are largely qualitative and not uniform between practices. The detection and remediation of ocular surface disease may also increase patient satisfaction with premium intraocular lenses.

Contact lens dissatisfaction is often related to abnormalities of the tear film (PMID 12772742). Although soft contact lens composition has been modified repeatedly with the intention of maximizing patient tolerance, it remains difficult to predict with which contact lens a particular patient will be satisfied. This is because assessment of the tear film has been largely qualitative. The introduction of a quantitative, objective, and AI-driven device is a step on the path to individualized contact lens recommendation for each patient.

Early detection and treatment of keratoconus produces tremendous societal and economic benefit.  Keratoconus, the progressive thinning and steepening of the cornea, is a disease that manifests in the patient’s teens and 20’s but diagnosis is often delayed by ten or more years. New cross-linking therapy is one-time and curative but relies upon early detection. The alternative treatment pathway (corneal transplant) is very expensive and ineffective.

Crosslinking generates 1.88 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with an average treatment age of 31.  However, if detection and treatment occurs at age 20 rather than 31, the QALY gain increases from 1.88 to almost 2.5. In the attached graph from “Costing Up Crosslinking”, The Ophthalmologist, July 25, 2022 https://theophthalmologist.com/subspecialties/costing-up-cross-linking, the blue line represents direct cost savings vs. corneal transplants. Translating the QALY benefit per incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) guidance, the value of detection and treatment at age 20 rather than 31 increases the economic value per patient from $470k to $625k.","Our solution is a designed-for-AI mobile device for the detection of dry eye, contact lens intolerance, and keratoconus. The device serves as a means for screening and triage in the setting of school health clinics and pediatric practices and as a tool of quantitative measurement for optometric and ophthalmology practices. In the role of screening, the device identifies high-risk individuals to facilitate referral to eyecare specialists where diagnosis can be confirmed and treatment initiated.","dry eye, contact lens, ocular surface disease, OSD, keratoconus, AI, ophthalmology, telemedicine","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Tilleron_Inc","No","No",""

Antigens are the protein spikes on the surface of a virus, e.g., the S spike of COVID-19. Once the virus entered human bodies, the viral spike binds to a specific receptor on human cells. This binding causes a conformational change in the antigen to enable membrane fusion and cell entry. The viral spike then transforms its structure from a pre-fusion to post-fusion state. Upon membrane fusion, the virus injects its genetic materials into the host cell and begins replication.

The pre-fusion conformation of a viral spike represents this virus antigen’s native, functional state. However, the pre-fusion conformation is a high-energy state with inherent instability (or termed “metastability”). The energy stored in the pre-fusion state drives membrane fusion and subsequent infection of a host cell. 

The post-fusion (infection) conformation is a low-energy state and possesses a more tightly packed structure than the pre-fusion conformation.

Safe and effective vaccines must present antigens in a stable conformation that closely mimics the functional viral spike in its pre-fusion state. The human immune system will produce neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to these pre-fusion spike, which subsequently deactivate the virus through binding to the spikes presented on the virions. Conversely, antibodies induced by post-fusion protein spikes are off-target and may not be nAbs. These off-target antibodies cannot block viral infection and may cause side effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) or vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) 

Most successful viral vaccines are virus-like particles (VLPs), which display an array of stable antigens        on the surface of a particle, such as the HPV vaccine Gardasil® 9 and the HBV vaccine Heplisav-B®. These VLP vaccines demonstrate a substantial level of efficacy (e.g., 90-100%) and safety. 

Most viruses are “ball-shaped”, except for filoviruses, with protein antigens displayed on their surface.  Through evolution, our immune system has acquired the ability to quickly recognize these “foreign” particles – especially when they are within a certain size range and display antigens symmetrically – and amount an effective immune response to block viruses and to kill infected cells.  

Vaccines designed by presenting stable pre-fusion antigens on a medium-size protein ball would be the best mimic of those viruses that can be easily recognized and eliminated by the immune system. The immune system would  “see” these vaccines as “invading viruses” and generate a rapid, strong, and long-lasting sterilizing immune response.
Uvax Bio’s 1c-SApNP® vaccine platform uses a multilayered nanoparticle carrier, which presents optimized pre-fusion antigens on the outside and carries a T-help signal within the nanoparticle core, thus enabling the induction of a broad and potent nAb response.

Each nanoparticle displays 20 trimeric or 60 monomeric antigens (45-70 nm), similar to the size of the HPV vaccine (60 nm), which is highly effective at eliciting nAbs.
The Uvax’s multilayered nanoparticle carrier offers superior structural and thermal stability, which in turn results in better trafficking to, and longer retention in lymph nodes upon immunization.","1.

The FDA cleared version will unlock surgical planning for medical device manufacturers of all sizes. Vent Minerva is effectively a “Waze for Surgery”.
Our product solves an important problem. Orthopedic surgery is a $15 billion market. Currently, total-knee surgery on average has only 70% patient satisfaction out of 1.25 million annual procedures in the US, growing approximately 6% YoY. Amazingly, most existing orthopedic surgeries today are archaic: they are either not planned at all, planned with X-rays alone, or planned from CT scans by company reps with minimal surgeon involvement. Ultimately, as a result, medical insurance ends up paying $5 billion per year in unnecessary expenses in the US alone and patients’ quality of life is substantially lowered. Additionally, segmentation and surgical planning for X-Ray or imaging-based modelling can cost manufacturers millions of dollars depending on the distribution and support of devices marketed. Even when the surgery is planned, surgeon preference for knee surgery can vary between multiple philosophies, so planning technicians need to be trained in multiple approaches to have a flexibility to support all customers. This generates an unreasonable burden for larger companies, and practically prevents medium to small innovative companies form entering a competitive landscape despite the various products they can help the patients with.","Vent’s software platform has solved this problem by providing surgeons with expert workflows that are validated and vetted, in order to ensure better surgical outcomes can be achieved regardless of the seniority and experience level of the surgeon. Initially, we are offering research-based segmentation, landmarking, and surgical planning tools that are driven by AI for our surgeon champions in HSS. Next group of products will solve the navigation, robotic surgery, and patient specific cutting guide surgery needs for our business partners by automating surgical plans and 3D printed guides based on cloud-based system we share with the users in a secure system. VENT is providing solutions in with the aid of the inVENT UI which can be licensed and used for cutting edge imaging analysis modality applications.
Unlike our competition, VENT is able to provide these solutions with a patented technology that displays medical imaging data with previously unseen density and Digital Twin modalities for both display and Augmented Reality modalities, which helps healthcare professionals make decisions without the need for overly technical know-how on the underlying analytics.  For Augmented Reality, our patented LIDAR tracking eliminates the need for navigation cameras for both nav and robotic surgeries, which is a bottleneck for those systems. The line-of-sight issue known in these technologies are a main concern for most surgeons, and the soft-tissue concerns that can't be addressed by a robot are resolved with LIDAR object tracking. Our patent covers all healthcare applications for soft and hard tissue surgeries.

Revision surgeries that may require the planning can also be planned with our system, reducing the time and cost of planning due to metal artefacts and complexities due to the patented point cloud approach. This will allow Vent to address both the primary and revision aspects of the knee arthroplasty surgery spectrum and have the option to expand to other joints and soft-tissue modalities in the future.
Our system is also priced competitively, with a SaaS pricing model of license fees broken to monthly installments, along with the per use fees depending on the use cases such as research, surgical planning, or clinical outcomes analysis. We provide embedded software packages, along with product development packages to orthopedic companies which are in need of data backed design tools.","Digital twin, AI/ML, Orthopedics, Surgical planning, Robotics, Augmented reality","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Vent_Creativity","No","No",""

Additionally, there were approximately 174,650 newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and 31,620 resulting deaths (Siegel et al., 2019). Lastly, over 80% of all prostate cancer patients are diagnosed with local prostate cancer (Noone et al., 2018; Ferlay et al., 2015; DeSantis et al., 2016). As the standard of care (SOC), men diagnosed with local prostate cancer have three therapy choices: 1) Surgery; 2) radiation therapy (RT)/chemotherapy which are associated with high five-year survival, but potentially cause debilitating side effects including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and bowel urgency; or 3) Active surveillance (AS) which does not have the side effects of surgery, RT, and/or chemotherapy, but involves painful repeat biopsies, anxiety due to living with untreated cancer, and the consequence of the cancer progressing to a more advanced clinical stage with a reduced five-year survival. Resnick et al., (2013) reported that 15 years after either prostatectomy or RT, prostate cancer patients had urinary incontinence (18.3% and 9.4%, respectively), insufficient erection for intercourse (87.0% and 93.9%, respectively), and bowel urgency (21.9% and 37.7%, respectively). In respect to AS, Scher’s dynamic progression model (2015) predicted 32.6% of prostate cancer patients diagnosed with local prostate cancer would progress to the “biochemical failure clinical stage” of prostate cancer associated with higher mortality than local prostate cancer.","Vitanova Biomedical (VNB) has developed a cancer therapy platform technology based on the ability to cause Light-Activated Intracellular Acidosis (LAIA) therapy and pH-induced cancer cell death. LAIA therapy involves the photo activation of nitrobenzaldehyde (NBA) by ultraviolet (UV) light, causing the release of H+ from NBA and subsequent rapid intracellular acidosis, apoptosis, and concomitant cell death. In vitro studies have proven LAIA therapy capable of causing > 80% cell death in five different cancer cell types including pancreatic, triple negative breast, and prostate cancer within 2 hours after light exposure. Additionally, in vivo studies in a nude mouse model utilizing triple negative breast cancer have proven LAIA therapy capable of reducing tumor volume and doubling survival with no adverse effects. 
VNB enhanced the clinical application of LAIA therapy’s light delivery by developing the ability to deliver light-activation to deeper tissue. This deeper light delivery has been achieved by conjugating NBA to a yttrium (Yt)-based upconverting nanoparticle (UCNP). Because UV light does not penetrate deep into tissue, our nanoparticle is formulated to receive deeper-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light, “upconvert” this NIR light to UV light, and emit UV light from the surface of the nanoparticle. This upconversion to and emission of UV light causes a rapid release of protons from NBA, and therefore, a rapid acidic intracellular environment. Additionally, VNB has targeted LAIA’s compound delivery by conjugating a cancer specific antibody/ligand to the surface of the NBA:Yt UCNP. This targeted UCNP will only enter cancer cells expressing the appropriate antigen/receptor on their surface. By targeting our UCNP to specific cancer cells, LAIA will effectively kill cancer without damaging nearby healthy tissue, a major advantage to the current SOC. Lastly, LAIA is an attractive treatment option for all cancer patients who fail to meet the SOC for their cancer, such as exceeding radiation dosage, inability to undergo surgery, or the presence of inoperable tumors. Because there is no current evidence that a cancer cell can develop a resistance to rapid, acute intracellular acidosis, LAIA is also an attractive treatment for patients with drug-resistant cancer.","Small Molecule Therapeutic, Prostate Cancer, Nanoparticle, Targeted Cancer Therapy, Energy-based Therapy","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/Vitanova_Biomedical","No","No",""

Scientific research has provided a wealth of molecular information about exploitable targets for many serious pathogens; targets that can provide protection or other therapeutic benefit if only a robust antibody response can be elicited.  Our VLP technology enables a highly-targeted and potent antibody response, allowing us to exploit these important scientific discoveries for therapeutic benefit.


Each year there are 350-500 million new cases of malaria  and the parasite is endemic on 3 continents in 90 countries inhabited by 40% of the world’s population: malaria is undeniably one of humanity's most serious disease burdens, yet the most advanced vaccine candidate (GSK’s RTS,S) has shown only very modest efficacy in its Phase III field trial. VLP Biotech’s malaria vaccine targets the same pre-erythrocytic stage as RTS,S, but is based on a dramatically more immunogenic VLP carrier. VLP Biotech’s publication in PLoS One demonstrating potent in vivo protection by our malaria vaccine has helped drive outside interest and we are currently advancing our vaccine as part of USAID’s Malaria Vaccine Development Program.

Hepatitis B is a global health problem with approximately 240 million individuals estimated to be chronically infected, with the single largest population being in China.  VLP Biotech offers a unique immunotherapy approach for chronic HBV by eliciting viral-neutralizing antibodies to block infection of naïve hepatocytes while stimulating patient T cell reponses by circumventing immune tolerance. This approach is designed to be combinable with current and new therapies to elicit functional cures and eliminate the elevated risk of cirrhosis and cancer associated with chronic HBV infection.","The founders of VLP Biotech have developed a chimeric virus-like-particle (VLP) platform technology to take advantage of the emerging “reverse vaccinology” field.  Our platform is based on a non-human pathogen for safety and to avoid issues of pre-existing immune tolerance.  Our technology is fully-recombinant, which enables production of chimeric VLPs that are fully self-assembling and expressed in E. coli or yeast for a low cost-of-goods.  Key advantages of our chimeric VLPs include: a precise matrix array of 240 epitopes per VLP ideal for B cell activation; encapsidation of TLR ligands within the particles; inexpensive expression and purification; heat stability and lyophilization compatibility not requiring a cold-chain.  These advantages have enabled us to address diseases related to global public health in addition to prevention of first world diseases.

VLP Biotech has established clinical candidate VLPs for its two lead vaccine programs: 1) a prophylactic malaria vaccine to block parasite infection and 2) an immune therapeutic approach to functional cure of chronic HBV infection. Each of these lead vaccine candidates have shown compelling pre-clinical neutralization and/or in vivo protection results.

We are also developing vaccines and immune therapeutics for new targets based on the capabilities and advantages of our VLP platform.  VLP Biotech is actively seeking partners and collaborators to advance our exiting programs or to evaluate using our VLP platform for new diseases aligned with partners’ strategic interests.  We have proof-of-concept for a variety of targets in which we elicit high antibody titers to affect a therapuetic or protective outcome.","Vaccine, HBV, Malaria, GPH, Hepatitis B","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/VLP_Biotech","No","No",""

VPIX introduces an innovative new digital biopsy tool to significantly improve the existing process.","Cancer surgery is a main treatment for cancer but some cancer patients have experience recurrence by tumor cells completely not removed in surgery. So, surgeons must confirm if any cancerous cells remain in the lesion before finalizing the operation. However, the only available option for surgeons is a frozen biopsy.  Frozen biopsy takes at least 30-40 minutes per case and provides low quality images as the cell is damaged during the pre-treatment process (freezing and cutting, etc). Because it takes a long time, surgeons send only few tissues, which leads to a sampling error. In addition, devices for frozen biopsy takes up a huge space as at least three types of large equipment have to be in place. Due to limitations of frozen biopsy, existing cancer surgery has been carried out inefficiently, with delayed operations and worsened prognosis of patients. The frozen biopsy process has remained more or less the same for the past 100 years without innovation.","VPIX Medical will replace frozen section biopsy used for the diagnosis of tumor cell in cancer surgery with a proprietary digital biopsy tool, cCeLL. cCeLL renders high quality images real-time with a touch of a pen-like probe without pre-treatment process. The images are then shared with the pathologists, for intraoperative guidance, shortening the whole workflow to less than 10 minutes. With cCeLL, surgeons can confirm more suspicious lesions and make better surgical decisions , not leaving anything to chances. cCeLL will help surgeons and hospitals to treat more cancer patients with more accuracy and speed than frozen biopsy, improving the overall efficiency during the cancer surgery.","Digital Biopsy, Confocal Fluorescence Imaging, Real-Time Clear Margin Detection, AI","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/VPIX_Medical","Yes","No",""

Ultra-protective ventilation (ventilatory volumes of 4 ml/kg of ideal body weight as compared to 12 ml/kg) has shown a ~20% increase in survival compared to standard techniques with a reduction in morbidity. However, due to the reduced ventilatory volume, CO2 cannot be adequately ventilated and accumulates in the body, an outcome termed hypercapnia. While not ideal, many patients can withstand the elevated CO2 concentrations without serious adverse consequences; however, in patients with underlying respiratory disorders (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), this can rapidly progress to hypercapnic respiratory failure, respiratory acidosis, and death.

Current technology to capture excess CO2 in blood is highly morbid and is associated with greater than 50% mortality during treatment. This therapy relies on half century old oxygenator-based CO2 removal technology that requires 1-7 LITERS of blood flow per minute, which can only be accessed via two 25+ Fr single lumen cannulae placed directly into a central vein. The insertion of this cannula requires special training, can only be performed by a limited number of physicians, and has a high failure rate. The blood flows required have been demonstrated to induce cerebral hemorrhage and lead to upwards of 75% mortality within 2 years after treatment cessation. Those that survive require extended stays in intensive care units for recovery, significantly increasing medical care cost.

This leaves more than 500,000 COPD patients each year critically underserved with elevated morbidity and mortality rates at a cost in the billions of dollars in the US alone. X-COR's respiratory dialysis technology removes excess CO2 directly from the blood, treating hypercapnia while leveraging dialysis workflows to seamlessly integrate into healthcare practices in a safe and effective manner. This is the first ultra-low flow extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal technology and is poised to upend critical respiratory care pathways.","X-COR Therapeutics has developed an ultra-low flow extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) therapy employing a dual CO2 capture technique that increases capture efficiency 5x compared to the standard of care. This is achieved by concentrating on the capture of the predominant chemical form of physiological CO2, bicarbonate, which equates to ~90% of all CO2 stores—5-7% is stored as gaseous CO2 and the remainder is bound to hemoglobin. While competitor oxygenator technologies capture the 5-7%, X-COR’s insight is the combination of gaseous capture of the minor form of CO2 and bicarbonate dialysis to capture the predominant form improves efficiency significantly while returning patients to a physiological homeostasis.

The high efficiency of the X-COR technology facilitates improved treatment at flow rates of only 0.25 liters per minute—a 12-28x reduction in flow compared to industry standard care. The placement of the 12-14 Fr dual lumen dialysis cannulae used in the X-COR technology is commonly performed in low acuity settings with low incidences of complications and no evidence of substantial morbidity due to the treatment. From rural clinics to large teaching hospitals, this procedure is commonplace. The reduced invasiveness of the treatment pared with improved availability will enable all 500,000+ acute exacerbation COPD patients to be adequately treated, reducing mortality at a fraction of the cost of treatment today for a potential $1-2 Billion in cost savings per year.","ECCO2R, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal, respiratory dialysis, hypercapnic respiratory failure, CO2, Medical device","https://jnjinnovation.com/JLABSNavigator/company/X-Cor_Therapeutics_Inc","No","No",""
