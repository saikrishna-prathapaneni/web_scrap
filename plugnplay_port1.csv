Automation Hero,"Automation Hero’s Hero Platform_ is the only completely end-to-end intelligent automation platform on the market that brings humans, AI, OCR, workflows, connectivity and insights together in one platform.
We believe that in order to automate a business process completely, the solution must support all elements: it must keep humans in the loop, be able to process documents, run workflows, integrate IT systems or processes, and provide the appropriate insights. An end-to-end solution is not only more efficient at all of this but it also — most importantly — allows for significantly faster results and therefore democratizes automation in larger and smaller organizations.

A common misconception is that individual tech tools provide better results. Best-in-class software for handwriting translation must be better than software that combines translation with other functions. Right? But in a time where AI capabilities double every 3.5 months, legacy tools are showing their age even faster, and the distance between companies built on modern platforms vs. those with duct-taped legacy tools quickly increases.

GeDy TrAss,"We contribute to a quick and accurate design of gearbox and power transmission systems with particular attention to the early stage design in order to accelerate the time to market. In addition, we can provide results in dynamic framework that are not so common to achieve.

GearDraft is based on an algorithm that automatically generates a whole mechanical transmission by inserting a few input data in a short time. The algorithm chooses the components (bearings, shafts, synchronizers, gears), their dimensions and their positions to satisfy the user initial requirements. GearDraft is useful during the blank-sheet pre-design phase, when a new transmission has to be thought from the beginning, or even when a different layout of the components is needed.

The power of the tool is to leave to the user complete freedom on the choice of the algorithm constraints, for instance the overall dimensions of the gearbox and the transmission ratio. Afterwards, the output can be converted into a CAD/FEM interfaceable with other commercial softwares. GearDraft’s aim is to make the user save time, cutting down the preliminary design operations often made “by hand”, and reinvest it for further detailed analyses.",http://gedytrass.com

INVENTIO.ai,"INVENTIO.ai: Artificial Intelligence for Industry Made Simple (https://www.inventio.ai)

Our solution is software: industrial apps integrate cutting-edge AI (machine/deep learning) and modern Web UI/UX technologies and designs. Our apps run completely at the edge, and we are strongly involved in hardware, since we are working hard to be completely hardware agnostic in our proposals. They can also run in hybrid and cloud environments.

We solve industries and manufacturing shop floor challenges at the edge, such as inspection, grasping proposition, anomaly detection and others. We provide “industrial-app” as products, focused on specific scenarios and custom solutions tailored on the customer’s business needs. We build our AI core on the latest research outcomes.",http://inventio.ai
HMDrive,"HMDrive has developed the first effective software solution enabling the usage of AR glasses on vehicles.

Invisens,"A family of 4D radars for automotive L2/3 and L4/5 applications. They are based on off-the-shelf parts and novel low-level software processing. It is not an imaging radar, but along with cameras covers almost any scenario. We also think of open radar processing libraries and datasets later on.

Problem solved: 
Automotive radars are black boxes developed by a limited amount of suppliers. It happens because, unlike cameras, radars implement either complex high- and low-level processing on the unit due to legacy constraints. Dependency on the limited amount of radar suppliers also disadvantages those who develop sensor fusion systems.

Solution: 
Eliminate bottlenecks in the radar architecture caused by conventional high-level processing. It is now split between a sensor fusion system a new low-level engine on the radar. It has consistent data processing rules that fit a sensor fusion system. The approach shows its best on custom radars but works for radar-on-chip as well.

Vision: 
A company that develops radars based on its IP and promotes the automotive radars idea in general. To make money we want to strategically partner with automotive suppliers/manufacturers.",http://invisens.com

Novac,"Novac supercaps are completely solid, thanks to the usage of innovative materials and procedures. The absence of liquid prevents explosions, leakages or evaporations which usually limit the number of possible applications of supercaps. The high safety and the wide temperature range are their most important competitive advantages.

Problem solved: At the moment the integration of supercapacitors into vehicles leads to different problems, all deriving from the presence of a liquid in their structure. They have a standard and bulky shape (this brings to constraints on the application fields), are unsafe, and work in a very limited range of temperatures. 
Solution: 
Novac solves these problems by developing a new generation of supercaps completely solid, using innovative materials and procedures. Furthermore, this supercap is completely mouldable. Thanks to this feature, it is possible to adapt it to different surfaces, reducing the encumbrance and easing the design of the vehicle.
