Stranded Solutions,"Stranded Solutions is commercializing a patented chemical process that is an industry first combining two well-known technologies to combat GHG emissions and increase oil and natural gas producers’ profits. One technology is the process of direct partial oxidation which combines natural gas with oxygen at elevated temperature and pressure to produce methanol. The other technology is a fluidized bed reactor which is a chamber in which the reaction occurs and that manages temperature and pressure to increase efficiency.  Methanol is a $42+ billion market expected to increase 5-fold by 2050. 
Stranded Solutions’ patented methane-to-methanol conversion technology can be scaled down to 1/100th the size of typical methanol plants, a solution that accommodates diverse types of smaller and non-traditional gas resources such as associated gas flared from oil wells.
Comments from a natural gas producer’s CEO and prospective customer: 
“Stranded Solutions uses the earlier simpler direct reaction process of “partial oxidization” (burning). This is less efficient but less capital intensive.  The potential low capital cost of Stranded Solutions’ process may become a “game changer” in upgrading natural gas in-field to higher value products.”",https://stranded-gas.com

Reco,"Reco believes that cloud collaboration tools have fundamentally changed the way modern organizations create business value. Attempting to secure these tools with techniques that were developed for legacy on-premises systems restricts collaboration, and misses a broad range of security events. Only by understanding the complete business context of an interaction, can security analysts identify, interpret, and determine the best way to respond to potential threats. Reco provides this business context.

Reco builds tools to secure sensitive assets for organizations by mapping and monitoring contextual metadata. Using applied machine learning, Reco creates a model of the relationships among an organization’s employees, teams, and third parties as they interact and collaborate, helping security teams understand and visualize threats from collaboration and sharing. In addition, Reco quickly plugs into tools like Slack, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Jira and more to create a contextualized knowledge graph through which security teams can detect and respond to unauthorized or anomalous activity instantly.",https://reco.ai

Paccurate,"Paccurate reduces shipping costs and wasted material by finding the optimal way to pack every shipment. It is crafted with real-world fulfillment concerns in mind, but they make a special effort not to be rigid. 

Cartonization refers to a step somewhere in an order lifecycle where the correct box configuration is determined for optimal shipping. It's a piece of the supply chain puzzle that's becoming more and more critical as ecommerce explodes and parcel carriers struggle with capacity. Typically three things are required to implement cartonization:
- Item Dimensions
- Box Dimensions
- Item/Business Rules & Constraints
Adding any kind of automated cartonization to your fulfillment process can have dramatic effects on your bottom line, but you may find that not all solutions are created equal.

As a rule of thumb, Paccurate more than pays for itself with saved corrugated, averaging a reduction of one square foot per carton in most cases. Reduce filler material by an average 20%. In addition, your negotiated rate tables have incentives built in to pack a certain way, depending on the dim weight and zone - Paccurate is the only cartonization solution that optimizes for these costs directly.",http://paccurate.io
