Trendi,"It’s not every day we waste half of our food… oh wait, yes it is. But we are here to change that.

At Trendi, we are using robotics, upcycling and social change to combat excess and unnecessary waste of misfit food from farms, cuttings from processors, waste from retailers and even the waste we produce in our own homes.

Wasting food is expensive not just in dollars and resources but also in emissions, and hungry stomachs. With over 2.5 billion tonnes of food going to waste (contributing to 10% of emissions) and over 800 million facing food insecurity around the globe, something needs to be done! We can all do a better job of preventing waste, and we’d like to invite you to join us in our mission.",https://trendi.com

Last20,"Last20 is a social enterprise that upcycles plastic waste into innovative solutions, like pavement. We are supplementing a portion of bitumen, the common binding agent in traditional pavement with low-density polyethylene, a plastic that is rarely recycled. Pavement made with recycled plastic preserves limited natural resources (less bitumen required), reduces total energy consumption, reduces total discarded solid waste and reduces C02, S02 (sulfur dioxide) and NO2 (nitrogen oxide) emissions, while maintaining the same or better performance. With economies of scale, this is a more cost-effective solution designed to upcycle tons of plastic waste that would typically end up in landfills or incineration. 
 
We are opening up conversations about climate change with our sustainability podcast called Sustainable Sessions. We host businesses, experts and public figures in this niche to discuss the different aspects of climate change and climate action to inspire individuals to make their own impact! Available on all streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music & YouTube!

AlignVR,"AlignVR has a unique technology that produces natural, observable behaviors that can be used for assessing or training soft skills — allowing for a far more accurate evaluation than traditionally available.

The core focus of our tech is on reducing the impact of something called Impression Management: the psychological term describing the mental effort we put into trying to inflate, filter or generally manage the impression we make on someone we interact with. People naturally use this in the workplace, when being observed (such as in team building activities) and in job interviews, frustrating the attempts to properly evaluate soft skill strength.

We use VR and psychology to inhibit a person's ability to use impression management and induce behaviors of interest in a virtual environment. Corporations observe these behaviors and use them to assess, build and improve their teams.

The results are amazing. One of our customers is the CEO of a publicly traded firm who said he learned more in 30 minutes of VR about his team than over the course of a year. A Global 500 company found that it increased their understanding of candidates and increased candidate's desire to work for the company. We provide a safe and predictable glimpse into who people really are!",http://www.alignvr.com

Automation Hero,"Automation Hero’s Hero Platform_ is the only completely end-to-end intelligent automation platform on the market that brings humans, AI, OCR, workflows, connectivity and insights together in one platform.
We believe that in order to automate a business process completely, the solution must support all elements: it must keep humans in the loop, be able to process documents, run workflows, integrate IT systems or processes, and provide the appropriate insights. An end-to-end solution is not only more efficient at all of this but it also — most importantly — allows for significantly faster results and therefore democratizes automation in larger and smaller organizations.

A common misconception is that individual tech tools provide better results. Best-in-class software for handwriting translation must be better than software that combines translation with other functions. Right?

GeDy TrAss,"We contribute to a quick and accurate design of gearbox and power transmission systems with particular attention to the early stage design in order to accelerate the time to market. In addition, we can provide results in dynamic framework that are not so common to achieve.

GearDraft is based on an algorithm that automatically generates a whole mechanical transmission by inserting a few input data in a short time. The algorithm chooses the components (bearings, shafts, synchronizers, gears), their dimensions and their positions to satisfy the user initial requirements. GearDraft is useful during the blank-sheet pre-design phase, when a new transmission has to be thought from the beginning, or even when a different layout of the components is needed.

The power of the tool is to leave to the user complete freedom on the choice of the algorithm constraints, for instance the overall dimensions of the gearbox and the transmission ratio. Afterwards, the output can be converted into a CAD/FEM interfaceable with other commercial softwares. GearDraft’s aim is to make the user save time, cutting down the preliminary design operations often made “by hand”, and reinvest it for further detailed analyses.",http://gedytrass.com
