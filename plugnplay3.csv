Kruzr Technology Solutions,"Kruzr is world’s first technology-powered driving assistant designed to help drivers understand and mitigate the avoidable risks they face on the road. This preventive motor insurance technology helps insurance companies understand their risk exposure accurately, create personalized insurance policies, and help their customer be safer on roads, helping them improve their claims ratio. 

Kruzr's risk measurement is the most comprehensive driving safety index, which not just measures acceleration, braking, turns, and speeding, but also captures distractions and fatigue levels of the driver. However, we not only measure what the driver is doing but also capture what the real-time traffic and weather conditions the driver has to encounter. This makes Kruzr's safety index truly contextual and comprehensive, making it more meaningful and useful for underwriting and actuarial purposes.

Electrified Thermal Solutions,"Burning fossil fuels to generate heat and electricity on-demand produces an enormous amount of carbon emissions. Wind and solar are cleaner but intermittent and can only deliver electricity, not the 1700-2000°C needed for intense industrial processes and to run efficient compressed-gas turbines.

A technology that converts intermittent electricity into constant high heat could transform the energy industry. Known options to store renewable electricity thermally—such as hydrogen, hot rocks, carbon blocks, or molten salts—are capital-intensive, not very efficient, or both. There is an urgent need for highly efficient, cost-effective options to produce carbon-free heat for steel and cement production and on-demand electricity for the grid.

Electrified Thermal Solutions is developing an energy storage technology that stores renewable electricity as 2000°C heat. Based on novel, low-cost conductive ceramics, this easily deliverable, zero-carbon heat is the most efficient and cost-effective option to replace fossil fuels in industrial plants and turbine power plants.

Karambit.AI automatically finds unauthorized modifications to software, keeping malicious updates from ever being installed.


Most software supply chain-related tools, fall into a few categories: SBOM generation, vulnerability analysis, and source-code analysis. None of these categories, while vital for constructing effective digital defenses, even address the problem exemplified by the SolarWinds malware insertion attack and other similar attacks that have been observed recently. 

The attack did not abuse vulnerabilities in the SolarWinds software. Instead, the attackers added malicious capabilities into the software development pipeline after the source code was compiled but before the code was digitally signed. This resulted in AV scanners and other defenses trusting the malware because it came from where it was expected with a valid signature. This malicious update then compromised 18,000 customers.

Vortis Carbon Co.,"Vortis is a carbon management company based in Calgary, AB focused on developing simple and affordable ways to capture, convert, and market Co2 emissions. Over the past three years, in partnership with the University of British Columbia's Clean Energy Research Centre, we have developed a novel approach to carbon capture that uses motion and vortex separation to separate CO2 based on its molecular weight. 

While molecular separation has commercially been proven in applications such as uranium enrichment, it has been overlooked for gas separation and carbon capture due to the need for high rpm's, energy, and costs required to create the high g-forces necessary for separation. Vortis has developed a novel way to overcome these hurdles by creating high g-forces at extremely low RPMs and energy. This approach is a new technology pathway for carbon capture.
 
Our approach is to apply this technology for point-source emissions targeting large emitters in the oil and gas, steel, and cement industries. Over the long term, we believe there are also opportunities to apply this technology to DAC applications.",https://www.vortis.ca

By putting the motive power in the railcar itself, they can reduce the shipment size and route distance typically required for railroad profitability and enable better competitiveness with trucking .Each year in the US alone, goods worth over $690bn are moved by a fleet of 1.6 million railcars. On any given day, 900,000 of these railcars don't move at all. And on every single leg of its journey, a loaded railcar will sit idle for an average of 24.6 hours - just waiting for a locomotive. Rail’s inefficiencies push many shipments to trucking, which is bad for society. Trucks emit 9x more GHGs per ton-mile than rail, add congestion to roads, and contribute to deadly accidents.

Qualle,"Qualle was established in late 2019 and just launched their soft beta in 2021 with Maersk. Qualle is building out a street turn automation tool, targeted at truckers to request the reuse of containers with shipping lines. A street turn is when a carrier uses a container from one trip, and instead of bringing the empty container back to the rail, they use it for a pickup. The carrier makes money from both loads while running less miles. 

Qualle takes an outdated process of communicating with the Steamship Lines to effectively facilitate Street Turn requests, while empowering truckers to do more by connecting fragmented dots between all stakeholders within the ecosystem. Their software helps with container triangulation to match import containers with exporters demand. Right now navigating and booking street turns is a very manual process and can take hours finding, uploading and negotiating prices through email. With Qualle’s first product “V1” you can do it all on one dashboard within minutes.

Unlike incumbent debt consolidation or financial health products, Debbie uses positive reinforcement  to improve the underlying negative financial behavior at the root of the vicious debt cycle and seamlessly transitions customers to aspirational wealth-building products (savings, investing, etc). This unique message, rather than offering quick cash and paternalistic automation, has allowed us to amass a waitlist of 15k+ users, mostly organically.

Peachscore,"The industry classified the early-stage businesses like the unbanked; they don't have a way to be measured effectively at scale.
There are 10’s of thousands of daily requests from early-stage businesses for financial support, POC’s with corporations, and to secure other critical resources. The evaluation, engagement, and decision-making process is manual, costly, and highly inefficient which has forced the industry to take a reactive approach. 

Typically the lifecycle of an early-stage business is 5 years. Within this window a group of them will be out of business, rest will transform into SMB’s, independent corporations, or hyper-growth startups. The majority of the industry waits up to 5 years in order to have enough quantitive results on these companies to make a confident decision on how to engage with them, which is too late.

We believe early-stage companies deserve to gain credibility to secure critical resources in a short period of time. The only path to achieving this goal is to create a comparable measurement system like those built for consumers, SMBs, & public companies in the last 50 years. Peachscore is a universal platform that uses data intelligently to assist and assess early-stage businesses at scale by leveraging directional scores and reports.",https://peachscore.com
