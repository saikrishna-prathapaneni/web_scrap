Forecast errors can lead to significant financial losses (e.g. failure to predict frost events, heat spikes, renewable energy under/over generation, etc.). To solve this problem, Benchmark's ML based weather forecasts for specific locations using publicly available information from the National Weather Service and real-time data from weather stations and other IoT devices. Benchmark Labs target market includes the global agriculture sector, as well as other fixed asset verticals such as the energy and insurance sectors.

Problem:
Food waste is often mixed with plastic waste and it is quite difficult to separate. If you incinerate them, you need high temperature, or dioxin, tar and high GHG emissions will be made. Huge recycling facilities are along with high CAPEX and OPEX due to high temperature and their centralized systems. 

Products:
We have two types of catalysts: “Kasumi” is to carbonize mixture of food waste (90% or more) and plastic waste (up to 10%) on site at a lower temperature than competitors. “Plastalyst” is to decompose plastics quite efficiently on site from polymer to monomer at lower temperature and pressure than competitors.",http://acbiode.com

This includes not only supporting trade, but also great future opportunities in financial products, market data, insurance, logistics, etc. This is a $60 billion USD market in Brazil, which is one of the world’s leading countries in agriculture.

Problem
Agriculture has faced a revolution over the last 20 years with modern harvesters, drones and more technology to increase productivity. However, in terms of trading, it continues doing business as before: using telephone (which is an archaic and inefficient process that generates a lot of information asymmetry in the physical market).

It is not an imaging radar, but along with cameras covers almost any scenario. We also think of open radar processing libraries and datasets later on.

Problem solved: 
Automotive radars are black boxes developed by a limited amount of suppliers. It happens because, unlike cameras, radars implement either complex high- and low-level processing on the unit due to legacy constraints. Dependency on the limited amount of radar suppliers also disadvantages those who develop sensor fusion systems.

Solution: 
Eliminate bottlenecks in the radar architecture caused by conventional high-level processing. It is now split between a sensor fusion system a new low-level engine on the radar. It has consistent data processing rules that fit a sensor fusion system. The approach shows its best on custom radars but works for radar-on-chip as well.
