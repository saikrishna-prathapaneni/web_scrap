Blacbird,,"In  close  cooperation  with  the  Fraunhofer  IISB  in  Erlangen,  Blacbird  Technologies  developed  a  novel  way  of  monitoring  electrical  networks.  Beyond  measuring  simple  state  variables  (currents  or  voltages),  like  most  ofour  competitors,  we  analyze  the  dynamic  behavior  (complex  impedance)  of  the  connected  circuit.  This  enables  usto  detect  changes  dueto  aging  effects,  status,  defects  or  modifications  and  create  a  unique  fingerprint  of  the  system  in  real-time.  State-of-the-art  measurement  techniques,  that  identify  the  complex  grid  impedance  inject  a  mono-frequent  test  signal  and  measure  the  response  amplitude  and  phase.  This  technique  is  very  accurate,  but  expensive,  takes  very  long  and  must  be  adapted  to  every  specific  use  case.  We  developed  a  way  of  determining  this  property,  that  is  very  cost-efficient,  faster  and  can  beaddedto  nearly  every  electrical  system  in  a  modular  way."

Our purpose is not just value creation for job seekers and employers — it is to re-shape the global labor market itself.
What job seekers do today is cast a wide net of employment applications of varying relevance. They spend countless hours formatting their CV, surfing job boards, and crafting elaborate profiles in hopes of being noticed amongst the crowd. Meanwhile, much of what human resource managers do is sifting through and screening the same candidates as their counterparts in other firms.
We wanted to stop this nonsense and allow HR managers to bypass this process by presenting them only the most fitting pre-screened candidates for their positions. At the same time we eliminated the need for candidates to keep applying.
At MoBerries, we are developing tools to navigate the bounty of choice that seems to characterize the labor market on both the supply and demand side. We are helping both sides find the signal in the noise.
There is an incredible amount of information in the 21st century job market, and MoBerries turns it into knowledge to empower all stakeholders.
