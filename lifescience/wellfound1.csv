Avatar for OneStudyTeam,/company/onestudyteam,"Boston, Remote","Reify Health provides cloud-based software that accelerates development of new and life-saving therapies. We serve the global life science industry, including thousands of clinical research sites, the most innovative biotechs, and the world’s largest biopharmaceutical companies.  Our global healthcare system relies on clinical trials to develop new, life-saving treatments for patients. But clinical trials continue to be slow, unpredictable, and expensive. Reify Health’s StudyTeam clinical trial software empowers both the research sponsors who drive clinical trials forward and the doctors and research coordinators who care for patient volunteers so that they can devote more focus and time toward the work that results in successful clinical research."
Avatar for PostEra,/company/postera-1,Boston,PostEra is building a modern 21st century biopharma. We’re using our advances in machine learning to close the Design-Make-Test cycle of Medicinal Chemistry and bring more cures to patients.  We've raised $26M from top tech/healthcare investors and signed over $370M in multi-year deals with partners like [Pfizer](endpts.com/a-new-ai-startup-has-emerged-and-pfizer-likes-what-it-sees) and the [NIH](endpts.com/nih-grants-over-500m-to-create-antivirals-for-future-pandemics).
Avatar for Aspect Analytics,/company/aspect-analytics-1,Genk,"We develop a cloud platform to manage and analyze spatial omics data, and integrate across different platforms. This brings various challenges, ranging from biology, bioinformatics and machine learning, up to scalable software engineering (HPC, DevOps, deep learning).  Our web stack is built in Clojure, whereas our computation engine is Python-based."
Avatar for Plex Research,/company/plex-research,Cambridge,"Our search engine scours all the world's biomedical research data, and finds the best answer for a given query.  The time is right for a drug discovery search engine: massive amounts of complex data are available, but hard to access, and each with its own caveats and levels of confidence. Our search engine gives scientists the best answer for their query, based on all available data. The results are simple, and all the supporting data is included, so they can come to their own conclusions."
Avatar for XAI.BiO,/company/xai-bio,Oxford,"XAI.bio is a deep tech therapeutics discovery and development startup. Incubated at Oxford University Innovation and based in Oxford, XAI.bio is expanding the frontiers of AI, biology and therapeutics."
Avatar for Statera Therapeutics,/company/statera-therapeutics-1,Connecticut,"Our products are curative therapeutic solutions built upon our proprietary Spatio-temporally tuned nanoparticles, in autoimmune diseases, allergies and cancer."
Avatar for nplex biosciences,/company/nplex-biosciences,Montreal,"nplex is developing a high-throughput proteomics platform for population-wide discovery. nplex was started by bioengineers at McGill University working together to untangle some of the most difficult problems in proteomics and meet the demand of high-throughput biology. Today, nplex’s team is focusing on precision profiling the human secretome to provide a complementary and orthogonal read-out within modern drug discovery pipelines."
Avatar for Cairn Biosciences,/company/cairn-biosciences-2,San Francisco,"Our platform visualizes the dynamic, multiscale cellular adaptations that underpin clinical outcomes, generating multidimensional, predictive disease-biology datasets fueling our drug discovery pipeline."
Avatar for DeepScience,/company/deepscience-2,Boca Raton,Overwhelmed by the complexity of a problem and unable to dig through the overabundance of information available in a reasonable time? Our solutions help propel your research forward.
